The club is willing to pay $6 million in add-ons in addition to the $25 million in fixed fees.</p><p>According to reports, Given Sanchez‚Äôs poor player-manager relationship, head coach Roberto De Zerbi reportedly examined other options. Last season, Brighton‚Äôs Spanish goalkeeper participated in 25 games. While recording eight clean sheets for his side the previous season, he gave up 30 goals. The clubs are allegedly in the process of finalising the agreement. However, specifics of Sanchez‚Äôs agreement with Chelsea have not yet been made public.</p><p>Kepa Arrizabalaga of Spain is the only goalkeeper the Blues currently have available to them. The club‚Äôs top pick for the past few months has been the shot-stopper with a valuation of $23 million. Given that Roberto Sanchez appears to be joining the team, Kepa‚Äôs spot in the first team may become a little more competitive. This is because new head coach Mauricio Pochettino is apparently trying to make some changes at the side following a disastrous campaign last year.</p><h4><strong>Salary of Roberto Sanchez at Brighton</strong></h4><p>Spanish goalkeeper Roberto Sanchez initially made the switch from Levante UD Youth to the Brighton U18 team. In the 2020‚Äì21 season, the club‚Äôs first team inked a contract with the 25-year-old goalkeeper. The star who is leaving the club signed a four-and-a-half-year contract back in February 2021 which would have ended on June 2025. He was receiving a weekly salary of about $29,000 under the pact. Even so, not much is known about his current club contract.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Sanchez appears to be leaving the club, despite the fact that his current contract still has almost two years to run. Sanchez may be on his way to a new chapter in his career after it was claimed that The Blues and Brighton have reached an agreement on a contract for the midfielder.</p><p>However, Chelsea isn‚Äôt just interested in signing the Spanish goalkeeper from Brighton. The Seagulls‚Äô Mois√©s Caicedo has also been on the club‚Äôs radar for a while.&nbsp; Although there have apparently been discussions between the two teams over the player‚Äôs potential transfer, nothing definitive has emerged to date.</p><p>Robert S√°nchez has a net worth estimated to be about $3 million.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong>PLAY: FREE ONLINE GAME</strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJrAsbvRraqgqpGeuW%2BvzqZmq6eSmr%2B1edKapZygla96tbuMnJ%2BepKOarm6%2FwKWYq7FdmLyvwNGamq1llJrBorXLrGStqpGjwKex0Wadnp1do7K1edaoqa2gXZa7pXnPmqmepqSofA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./my-truist-app-is-not-working-navigating-app-troubles.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>My Truist App is Not Working: Navigating App Troubles</span></a>
