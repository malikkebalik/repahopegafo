His collaboration with Jameer Nelson at St. Joseph’s formed one of the country’s best backcourts, leading the university to the Elite Eight in the 2004 NCAA Tournament.</p><p><img data-expand=600 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/kahawatungu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1-114.png alt="Delonte West Net Worth" width=1177 height=884 data-sizes="(max-width: 1177px) 100vw, 1177px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Delonte_West_NBA_Career></span><strong>Delonte West NBA Career </strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Drafted as the 24th pick by the Boston Celtics in the 2004 NBA Draft, West faced early challenges due to injuries. Despite his struggles, he earned the starting point guard position in the 2005-06 season. Transitions between positions marked his career, with stints at the Seattle Supersonics and Cleveland Cavaliers.</p><p><strong>Also Read</strong>: <a href=#>David Letterman’s Net Worth</a></p><p>In 2008, he signed a three-year contract worth $12.7 million with the Cavaliers, showcasing his defensive prowess and shooting skills. Subsequent trades and contracts with teams like the Minnesota Timberwolves and a one-year deal with the Boston Celtics followed. Unfortunately, his career was marred by legal troubles, including a guilty plea to weapons charges.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Financial_Struggles></span><strong>Financial Struggles</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Despite his substantial earnings, Delonte West faced persistent financial and personal challenges. The NBA lockout saw him reportedly living out of the Mavericks’ locker room, selling jewelry and cars to make ends meet. A temporary job application at Home Depot underscored the depths of his financial struggles. Legal fees from various issues, coupled with a challenging divorce, contributed to his financial woes.</p><p>Photographs in August 2019 depicted West in a destitute state, and he was later seen walking shoeless in a fast-food restaurant parking lot. In September 2020, he was photographed panhandling in Dallas, Texas. The situation took a positive turn when Mavericks owner Mark Cuban intervened, bringing West to a drug treatment program. Delonte briefly experienced a reversal of fortunes, reuniting with family and working at the rehab facility.</p><p><img data-expand=600 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/kahawatungu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2-99.png alt="Delonte West Net Worth" width=1165 height=882 data-sizes="(max-width: 1165px) 100vw, 1165px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Recent_Setbacks></span><strong>Recent Setbacks</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Unfortunately, the positive momentum was short-lived.
