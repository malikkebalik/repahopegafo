Johns' nine-year comic book run on Green Lantern superheros single-handedly redefined the mythos of the corps.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span> <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><img alt=Gl-Corps-Mad-Ghost height=400 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodmask.com/uploads/images/glcorps.jpg width=264 ezimgfmt="rs rscb1 src ng ngcb1" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><strong>Photo Source:</strong><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span> (Madghost Production) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Who is Guy Gardner?</h2><p>Not many will be familiar with Guy Gardner's version of Green Lantern. He has seldom appeared in Green Lantern adaptations—live-action or otherwise.</p><p>He is mostly sidelined in favor of John and Hal. However, he was actually the second choice to don the emerald ring when Abin Sur's ship crashed on Earth.&nbsp;</p><p>In the comics, Gardner comes from a family of police officers. His father, who himself is a decorated ex-cop, frequently beat Guy when he was young.<span>&nbsp;</span>But he<span>&nbsp;worked hard to excel in school to impress his father.</span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span>Tired of trying to impress his abusive father, Guy then turned out to be a juvenile delinquent who&nbsp;frequently got into trouble breaking the law.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>But he eventually straightened out, though. He started his university with a renewed sense of self. While in university, he channeled his aggression through college football and even supported himself financially.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>After college, he joined the Baltimore Police Department, like the rest of his family. Three years into the force, he shot a suicide bomber before he could get on a plane, and the resulting explosion killed ten bystanders.</span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p><span>In the aftermath, Guy resigned from the force, and his resignation resulted in an even bigger rift between himself and his father.</span></p><p><span>Eventually, he would make peace with his father before his death.</span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2><span>Guy Gardner Nature</span></h2><p>Guy has an aggressive approach in his missions, which is often disapproved by fellow members of the corps. His unwillingness to follow restrictions bound by the Guardians is also what makes him a&nbsp;unique lantern. He has oftentimes channeled his underlying propensity for aggression to finish a mission quickly.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>It&nbsp;will certainly be interesting to see how Guy's personality translates on the big screen alongside the other lanterns in Green Lantern Corps.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><h2>Guy Gardner&nbsp;Reveal In 'Green Lantern Corps'</h2><p>Along with his writing duties in Green Lantern Corps, Johns will also be producing the film.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">website</a>&nbsp;of his production house (Madghost Productions) has listed several films under development, including&nbsp;Green&nbsp;Lantern Corps—the movie is listed with a&nbsp;picture featuring&nbsp;Guy Gardner alongside Hal Jordan and John Stewart.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><img alt=guy-gardner-daily-green-lantern height=400 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodmask.com/uploads/images/guy-gardner.png width=311 ezimgfmt="rs rscb1 src ng ngcb1" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p><span>With the recent news coming in that</span><span> </span><a href=# rel=follow>the film will&nbsp;involve other Green Lanterns of Earth</a><span>, the picture certainly&nbsp;hints that a new addition will be non-other than Guy Gardner.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Green Lantern Corps Release Date Plot and Cast</h2><p>The plot for the film hasn't been announced yet, but it is&nbsp;confirmed that the film will focus on the entire corps and not just one lantern.</p><p>The casting too seems to be a little down the line with <a href=# rel=follow>several possible actors being rumored to play Hal</a>&nbsp;and <a href=# rel=follow>John Stewart</a>.
