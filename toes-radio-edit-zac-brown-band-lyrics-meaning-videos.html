Zac Brown Band Lyrics
Jump to: Overall Meaning ↴&nbsp;&nbsp;Line by Line Meaning ↴I got my toes in the water, ass in the sand
Not a worry in the world, a cold beer in my hand
Life is good today, life is good todayWell, the plane touched down just about three o'clock
And the city's still on my mind
Bikinis and palm trees danced in my head
I was still in the baggage line Concrete and cars are their own prison bars Like this life I'm living in"><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

The lyrics beautifully illustrate the experiences of the singer being in the moment and immersed in the soothing experience of being at the beach. The use of phrases such as "I got my toes in the water, ass in the sand/ Not a worry in the world, a cold beer in my hand/ Life is good today, life is good today" sets the joyous, relaxed and carefree tone of the song. It portrays a simple yet rejuvenating experience of enjoying the sun, the beach, sea, and sand in the company of friends with a beer and guitar in hand. The song celebrates the working people who go out and make a living and then unwind and take in the good things in life like vacations and time with loved ones.</p><br><p>The second section of the song, starting with "Well, the plane touched down just about three o'clock," contrastingly describes the somewhat depressing feeling of leaving the beautiful beach and heading back to ordinary life. The words "Concrete and cars are their own prison bars/ Like this life I'm living in," reflects the mundanity of everyday life and how it can often feel like a prison, but the singer realizes that there is always a beautiful escape in the form of enjoying life with friends and loved ones. The beautiful imagery of the beach is depicted beautifully in this song, which is an uplifting and joyful experience to listen to.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>I got my toes in the water, ass in the sand</u><br>I am standing in the water and sitting on the sand</p><br><p><u>Not a worry in the world, a cold beer in my hand</u><br>I have no concerns or anxiety and I am holding a cold bottle of beer</p><br><p><u>Life is good today, life is good today</u><br>I am enjoying my time and life is good today</p><br><p><u>Well, the plane touched down just about three o'clock</u><br>The plane landed around 3 in the afternoon</p><br><p><u>And the city's still on my mind</u><br>I am still thinking about the city</p><br><p><u>Bikinis and palm trees danced in my head</u><br>I am thinking of bikinis and palm trees</p><br><p><u>I was still in the baggage line</u><br>I am still in line waiting for my baggage</p><br><p><u>Concrete and cars are their own prison bars</u><br>Being surrounded by concrete and cars feels like being in prison</p><br><p><u>Like this life I'm living in</u><br>I feel trapped in my current life</p><br><p><u>But the plane brought me farther</u><br>The plane took me to a distant location</p><br><p><u>I'm surrounded by water</u><br>I am surrounded by water</p><br><p><u>And I'm not going back again</u><br>I do not plan to return to my previous location</p><br><p><u>Adiós and vaya con Dios</u><br>Goodbye and go with God</p><br><p><u>Yeah, I'm leaving GA</u><br>I am departing from Georgia</p><br><p><u>And if it weren't for Tequila and pretty senoritas</u><br>If it were not for Tequila and attractive women</p><br><p><u>I'd have no reason to stay</u><br>I would have no reason to remain here</p><br><p><u>Gonna lay in the hot sun and roll a big fat one</u><br>I am going to bask in the sun and smoke a large marijuana joint</p><br><p><u>And grab my guitar and play</u><br>I am going to play my guitar</p><br><p><u>The four days flew by like a drunk Friday night</u><br>The last four days passed rapidly</p><br><p><u>As the summer drew to an end</u><br>The summer season is coming to an end</p><br><p><u>They can't believe that I just couldn't leave</u><br>My friends are surprised that I could not depart</p><br><p><u>And I bid adieu to my friends</u><br>I say goodbye to my friends</p><br><p><u>Because my bartender she's from the islands</u><br>My bartender comes from the islands</p><br><p><u>Her body's been kissed by the sun</u><br>The sun has darkened her skin</p><br><p><u>And coconut replaces the smell of the bar</u><br>The aroma of coconuts replaces the smell of the bar</p><br><p><u>And I don't know if it's her or the Rum</u><br>I am not sure if I am attracted to her or the alcohol</p><br><p><u>A long way from GA</u><br>Far away from Georgia</p><br><p><u>Yes, and all the muchachas they call me Big Poppa</u><br>The girls call me Big Poppa</p><br><p><u>When I throw pesos their way</u><br>When I give them money</p><br><p><u>Someone do me a favor and pour me some Jäger</u><br>Please pour me a Jägermeister shot</p><br><p><u>Going home now to stay</u><br>I am returning home permanently</p><br><p><u>The senoritas don't care-o when there's no dinero</u><br>The girls do not care when there is no money</p><br><p><u>Yeah, I got no money to stay</u><br>I do not have any money to remain here</p><br><p><u>And put my ass in a lawn chair</u><br>I plan on sitting on a lawn chair</p><br><p><u>Toes in the clay</u><br>My toes will be stuck in the clay</p><br><p><u>Not a worry in the world a PBR on the way</u><br>I have no concerns and a Pabst Blue Ribbon beer is on the way</p><br><p><u>Life is good today</u><br>I am enjoying my life today</p><br><p><u>Life is good today</u><br>I am experiencing a good day today</p><br><p><span class=lyrics-text>Lyrics © BLACKSTONE ENTERTAINMENT, BMG Rights Management, REACH MUSIC PUBLISHING, Songtrust Ave, Warner Chappell Music, Inc.<br>Written by: John Hopkins, Shawn Mullins, Wyatt Durrette, Zac Brown</span></p><p>Lyrics Licensed & Provided by <a class=ext-link href=# rel=nofollow>LyricFind</a></p>To comment on or correct specific content, <span>highlight it</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn6O2pLTIrapnm5%2BifLe1w56maJKRmKyDvs6wpZh6kaOxcKDOnqqYYIKWsaq7vn6boqxZ</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sean-mcvay-wife-meet-rams-coach-wife-veronika-khomyn-expecting-first-child-family.html><span>←</span><span>Sean McVay Wife, Meet Rams Coach Wife Veronika Khomyn, Expecting First Child, Family</span></a>
