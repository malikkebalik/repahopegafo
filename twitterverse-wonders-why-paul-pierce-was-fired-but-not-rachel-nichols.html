From racism to misconduct and indecent harassment, stars will be held accountable for everything they say and do.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Recently Boston Celtics legend and ESPN analyst <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Paul Pierce</a> and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Rachel Nichols</a>, another NBA analyst on ESPN, found themselves the target of cancel culture.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Pierce Fired After Racy Video</h2><p>In April, Pierce uploaded a suggestive clip on Instagram in which he was seen smoking and playing poker with his friends while several women twerked in the background. It didn’t take long for basketball fans, along with the rest of Twitter, to slander the former All-Star.&nbsp;</p><p>Shortly after this incident, it was reported that ESPN had parted ways with Pierce effective immediately, a subtle way of saying he was fired.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The suggestive nature of the clip was likely unacceptable for ESPN — a company owned by the family-friendly Walt Disney Company. In the video, Pierce and his buddies also appeared maskless and disobeying Covid protocols set up at the network. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Since retiring from the league in 2017, the former NBA Finals MVP had been an analyst for the network on multiple NBA shows. Some shows included Nichols’ weekday show&nbsp;The Jump&nbsp;and its pregame show,&nbsp;NBA Countdown.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The news came two weeks&nbsp;after Pierce was announced as a finalist for the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame class of&nbsp;2021.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Nichols Parted Ways with ESPN</h2><p>Similarly, <a href=# rel=follow>Nichols</a> was slandered after critical comments&nbsp;she made about a Black colleague&nbsp;came to light.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Nichols was both a sports analyst, an anchor, and&nbsp;host of&nbsp;The Jump&nbsp;on ESPN. She started covering the game in 1995 and was considered the most accomplished woman in&nbsp;the field.&nbsp;</p><p>Recently, the recording of her private conversation with Adam Mendelsohn, LeBron’s spokesperson, was leaked, and the story was covered by the New York Times.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Rachel Nichols history:</p><p>Brought up D Rose’s rape allegations the night after he had 50</p><p>Asked Dame if he felt bad for beating the Lakers on Kobe night</p><p>Said Lebron should win MVP because of Kobe’s death</p><p>And now is saying Maria Taylor is working the finals because of her race — ð™ˆð™–ð™©ð™©¹³ðŸŽ¡ (@thehurryupnba) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">July 4, 2021</a></p><p>In the audio, Nichols, who is Caucasian, says&nbsp;Maria Taylor, who is&nbsp;&nbsp;African American, was chosen over her&nbsp;to be the head of last year’s NBA Finals coverage because of the company’s diversity efforts.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>People were vexed over her comments, and the first thing that all NBA Fans did was dig up her past, which apparently seems far worse than what people expected. Over the years, she had made many insensitive remarks and gotten away without penalty.&nbsp;</p><p>These people also noted that the treatment was unfair as Pierce lost his job for a less severe offense than Nichol’s. Nichols apologized on-air following the news, saying she was “deeply, deeply sorry I am for disappointing those I hurt, particularly Maria Taylor.”</p><p>With the world watching out for ESPN’s reaction, the network announced shortly after that Nichols would&nbsp;no longer be the network’s sideline reporter for the NBA Finals.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKiRqrluvMieqZydXaeupLTEpWSnoZOdvK2%2FjKyamqaUlrlvtNOmow%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./toby-sebastian-is-a-talented-actor-and-musician-get-to-know-florence-pugh-s-older-brother.html><span>←</span><span>Toby Sebastian Is a Talented Actor and Musician Get to Know Florence Pugh's Older Brother</span></a>
