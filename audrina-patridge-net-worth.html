To the public, Audrina Patridge is perhaps best known for appearing in the reality television series entitled “The Hills”, which focused on both Patridge’s professional and personal life. Even though the show started off with a spotlight on <a href=#>Lauren Cohan</a>, it gradually shifted its attention towards Patridge and her friends <a href=#>Heidi Montag</a> and <a href=#>Whitney Port</a>.</p><h3>Audrina Patridge Net Worth $5 Million</h3><p>The show produced six seasons and during its time on air received rather favorable reviews from the critics, as well as its audience. In addition to that, “The Hills” also inspired the creation of several other spin-off series, including “The City”, “Kell on Earth” and “Audrina”. The latter show was cancelled soon after its debut, as it failed to gather the attention of the audience and secure itself positive reviews.</p><p>Some of Audrina Patridge’s other notable appearances include “Dancing with the Stars”, minor roles in “Scary Movie 5” with <a href=#>Ashley Tisdale</a>, <a href=#>Simon Rex</a> and <a href=#>Heather Locklear</a>, as well as “Honey 2” with Katerina Graham, and “Sorority Row” with Briana Evigan. A famous actress and television personality, how rich is Audrina Patridge? According to sources, Audrina Patridge’s net worth is estimated to be $5 million.

Audrina Patridge’s rise to fame started with “The Hills”, which was originally created as the spin-off series of another reality television show called “Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County”. It was largely due to this show that Patridge earned a lot of public exposure and media attention. Initially, Audrina Patridge wanted to leave the show in 2009 and desired to focus on her own reality series that would show her personal and professional life outside of “The Hills”. However, Audrina Patridge then went on to sign a contract for the sixth season and eventually appeared in the last season of the show.</p><p>Apart from “The Hills”, Patridge has had a fairly successful acting career. She debuted in Hollywood in an action film with <a href=#>Chris Carmack</a> and <a href=#>David Anders</a> called “Into the Blue 2: The Reef”, where she had a small role, and that same year portrayed a character of Megan Blaire in a slasher film entitled “Sorority Row”.</p><p>In addition to making appearances in films, Audrina Patridge went on to star in such television series as “MADtv”, “Do Not Disturb” with <a href=#>Jerry O’Connell</a> and <a href=#>Jesse Tyler Ferguson</a>, “Family Guy”, and, more importantly, “Dancing with the Stars”, where together with her dancing partner <a href=#>Tony Dovolani</a>, she took seventh place. In 2011, Patridge debuted with her own reality series entitled “Audrina”, however it was on air only for one season, during which it produced ten episodes. Currently, Audrina Patridge is hosting a lifestyle series called “1st Look”.</p><p>A famous actress, Audrina Patridge has an estimated net worth of $5 million.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=22.558631921824><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Audrina Patridge</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>May 9, 1985</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Los Angeles, California, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5 ft 7 in (1.71 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>125 pounds</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Profession</td><td>Actor, Model, TV Personality, TV presenter</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>El Dorado High School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Corey Bohan</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Kirra Max Bohan</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Mark Patridge, Lynn Patridge</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Siblings</td><td>Casey Patridge Loza, Samantha Patridge, Mark Patridge</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Nicknames</td><td>Audrina Cathleen Patridge , Drina , Aud</td></tr><tr readability=0.22857142857143><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.facebook.com/pages/Audrina-Patridge/108068679221818</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.31111111111111><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.twitter.com/audrinapatridge</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.36734693877551><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.instagram.com/audrinapatridge</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.35897435897436><td>MySpace</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.myspace.com/audrinaxo</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.23529411764706><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://imdb.com/name/nm2526306</a></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Awards</td><td>ShoWest Award - Female Star of Tomorrow (2009)</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Nominations</td><td>Teen Choice Award - Choice TV: Female Reality/Variety Star (2011), Choice Movie Actress: Horror/Thriller (2010)</td></tr><tr readability=10><td>Movies</td><td>“MADtv”, “Do Not Disturb” (2008), “Family Guy” (2009), “The Hills” (2006-2010), “The City”, “Kell on Earth”, “Audrina” (2011), “Into the Blue 2: The Reef” (2009)</td></tr><tr readability=8><td>TV Shows</td><td>“Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County”, "The Hills" (2006-2008), “The City”, “Kell on Earth”, “Audrina”, “Dancing with the Stars”</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=21.795687134503><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=6.5792349726776><td>1</td><td>(November 5, 2016) Married her boyfriend of 8 years and father of her 4-month-old daughter Kirra, <a href=#>Corey Bohan</a>, in front of 130 guests in Hawaii, following a 12-month-long engagement.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>2</td><td>Her daughter Kirra weighed 3.742134 Kilos or 8 lbs 4 oz three weeks early at birth.</td></tr><tr readability=5.5540540540541><td>3</td><td>Gave birth to her 1st child at age 31, a daughter named Kirra Max Bohan on June 24, 2016.
