According to a story in Russian media on March 4, 2023, the deceased scientist was cruelly strangled to death with a belt in his Moscow flat.</p><p>Mr. Botikov, who worked at the Gamaleya National Research Center for Environment and Mathematics, was reportedly discovered dead on Thursday, according to the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation.</p><p>For his efforts on the covid vaccine, Vladimir Putin (the Russian President) also gave him the Fatherland honor in 2021. Out of the 18 scientists, Andrey was reportedly present while developing the Sputnik V vaccine in 2020. His death is being investigated as a probable murder, according to a Telegram statement from the committee, the investigative body in Russia.</p><p>A young suspect, 29, has reportedly been seized by police in connection with the murder of Andrey Botikov, according to a story in Russian media. A young suspect, 29, has reportedly been seized by police in connection with the murder of Andrey Botikov, according to a story in Russian media. Investigators assert that after disputing with Botikov, the suspect choked him with a belt and then fled. Law enforcement authorities also disclosed to the local media that the incident included domestic violence and was the result of a quarrel.</p><p>According to official reports, the 47-year-old virologist died as a consequence of a failed burglary.

Due to his trial for an alleged serious offense, the defendant has a criminal past. The inquiry will soon urge the court to detain the defendant until trial.</p><p>Although their contributions to science and research are recognized and treasured, it is always a big loss when a scientist with experience and expertise dies away.</p><h2><span id=Andrey_Botikov_Who_Was_He>Andrey Botikov: Who Was He?</span></h2><p>As was already said, Andrey was a devoted and enthusiastic scientist who gave his all to the welfare of society.
