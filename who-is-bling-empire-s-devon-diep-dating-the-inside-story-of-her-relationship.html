She’s a multi-hyphenate who does it all, from modeling to performing to directing, so that’s the first thing to note.</p><p>Devon grew up with her parents and siblings in Boston, where she lived most of her childhood. In an essay for Boston Man Magazine, she wrote about her family relationships. She said, “I often remind myself that my parents fled to a foreign country with no money, had to learn another language, and risked their lives for us to have a better future than we had in Vietnam. I vowed to myself that I would accomplish my goals and honor them.</p><p>Devon has acted in The Heat, Jessica Jones for Marvel, and Defense Jacob for Apple TV+. Additionally, she is a musician who has created, produced, and directed several of her own music videos, including the one for the tune “Do You Believe.” She penned the “Green Dragon” title tune for the Martin Scorsese-executive produced movie Revenge of the Green Dragons in 2014. Not to mention, she wrote and directed Air, a self-produced short film.</p><p>As fans get to know Devon, there has been some talk about the newcomer’s private life. There are even rumors that Devon and Kevin Kreider are together. So, who is Devon Diep dating? Here is what we know.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who Is Devon Diep Dating?</h2><p>People often wonder about <a href=#>the people in Bling Empire</a> and who they date, but little is known about Devon’s love life. Devon is not <a href=#>dating </a>anyone, according to his Instagram page. But that doesn’t mean she doesn’t have a boyfriend. Devon may just like her privacy.</p><p>On the show, Devon is shown to be Kevin’s ex-girlfriend. At the end of the trailer, Christine tells the group about Devon. The DJ shakes Kim Lee’s hand and says, “You are… his ex-girlfriend.” The clip ends after that.</p><p>Unfortunately, the clip doesn’t say for sure who Devon used to date. But based on Kim’s response, it seems likely that Kevin is the guy in question.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by Devon Diep (@devondiep)</a></p><p>Also, comments on Devon’s Instagram post of the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>B</strong><strong>ling Empire Season </strong><b>3 trailer</b></a>&nbsp;shows that the two may have been dating. At the very least, it looks like there might be some history there.</p><p>Christine Chiu, who was also in the show, said, “I’ve never seen Kevin happier, so thank you for coming back.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Kevin and Devon from Bling Empire are in love and share a home in Los Angeles.</h2><p>Devon and Kevin are still courting, and they are currently residing together in Los Angeles. She relocated from Boston to reside with me, Kevin revealed in an interview with E! Kevin acknowledged that the process had not been simply because they had moved three times in their six weeks of living together. The couple’s relationship has become a little strained due to the circumstance, but they are still deeply in love. Kevin, who is a member of the original ensemble, hopes Devon will take a full-time role in Bling Empire season 4. She is ideal for the program, according to Devon, a model, actor, singer, writer, and director.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Devon-Diep-Dating.jpg><p>The cast, particularly Kim and Kane Lim—whom Bling Empire fans loved—reacted differently when Christine presented Devon to them as Kevin’s girlfriend. Kevin stated in the E! interview that he and Kim are not as close as they once were. The same could be said of his friendship with Kelly and his fellow actors Kane. “I believe she is now showing a little more consideration for the bond between us. Kelly and I don’t really discuss relationships all that much. He acknowledged, “I don’t believe I feel comfortable talking to him about relationship stuff, which I think is also true with the dynamic with Kane.</p><p>Fans of Bling Empire observed Kevin’s attempts to mend fences with his pals Kane, Kim, and Kelly this season. Although some viewers thought Kevin was being overly dramatic at times, some of his worries about their relationship are legitimate. However, they have since worked out their differences and are once again friends. Devon revealed to Netflix that she and Kevin are establishing a production business together when asked about the couple’s future plans. She disclosed that the business will be called ALLS Productions and that it will concentrate on telling Asian-led love tales.</p><h2>Tensions May Occur Between Devon Diep And Kim Lee</h2><p>In Season 2, Kevin made it clear that he wanted to take things with Kim to the next level. But after Kim put Kevin through several tests, including a lie detector test, she told the model that she wasn’t ready for a relationship.</p><p>In the Season 3 trailer, Kevin talks to Kim about how she brought another guy around. Then Kim says something shocking: Kevin is just not her type.</p><p>So, if Kevin still has feelings for Kim when Devon shows up, it’s possible that there will be tension between Kim and Devon. It will be interesting to see what happens. You can stream Seasons 1–3 of Bling Empire on Netflix right now.</p><p><strong>Read more :</strong></p><ul><li><a href=#>Is Naomie Olindo Dating Whitney Sudler-smith?
