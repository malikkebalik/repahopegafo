I don’t know if Ava is going to out her to the whole town, or just Sonny, Krissy and Blaze. It will be interesting though.

I detailed it in the following post.</p>After the wedding Natalia stopped by Sonny’s condo with a thank you gift for having invited her to the wedding. Ava was sitting on the couch with her phone and she was trying to do a pre-recorded blurb for the gallery show that she’s planning. She had a couple of starts and then on her third attempt, she pressed the record button on her phone but then there was a knock on the door so she got up with her phone in hand and walked to the door and there was Natalia. She invited Natalia into wait… <img alt width=24 height=24 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/m/35a633/48.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> Melanie:<p>I am thinking the tape goes public and the record deal gets canceled. That would devastate Blaze, if she gets fired because of her mother’s bigotry.</p><p>Why would Blaze’s record deal be cancelled… they dont care that she’s gay. The only thing this recording could do, is make Sonny mad at Natalie…</p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><p>And if Blaze loses her record deal she will have no career. Thus, she can be an insta mommy with Kristina.</p><p>Nothing will happen. Kristina already forgave Sonny the hoodlum so Blaze will get PO’d for a sec then all is forgiven. They’re matching Natalia and Sonny together so I doubt she’ll be disliked for long & all will be back to normal.</p><p>You go Ava! Didn’t get to say that Trina’s shock of Ava’s words against Sonny the Hoodlum was ridiculous. It really frightened her? Really? Trina and Kristina what rock were they hiding under all this time? <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/roll_eyes.png title=:roll_eyes: alt=:roll_eyes: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/thinking.png title=:thinking: alt=:thinking: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><p>I’m thinking the general public and her fans would feel really sorry for Blaze because her mother is such an ass and backwards. It might even help her move up in the world as far as music.</p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><img alt width=24 height=24 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/s/e5b9ba/48.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> Soaps808:<p>They’re matching Natalia and Sonny</p><p>Such a forced pairing.

Probably because she’s a gold digger.</p><p>I can’t believe she’s upset that her daughter is gay yet she’s trying to take up with a mob Don!</p><p><span class=post-likes>6 Likes</span></p><p>One doesn’t really have anything to do with the other. But both are independently not good traits to possess.</p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><p>I think it will wipe out any illusions Blaze had about her mom being ok with who she is & her relationship with Kristina, and since her mom has always been up in her business (“supportive stage mom”), for Blaze it’s going to be really hurtful that a. her mom was ‘faking’ her support of her relationship and b. her mom / closest advisor maybe didn’t really have her best interests at heart all along.</p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><p>Well, the spoilers video for this week tells us exactly how it happens.</p><p>A source “Ava” evidently gives the recording to the gossip columist at The Invader. And naturally, everyone reads The Invader. From the video, Maxie, Lucy, Lois, Sonny, Alexis and Diane and though the video doesn’t show Blaze and Kristina’s reaction, one could logically assume they will hear it as well.</p><p>This is going to be put in motion today. Looks like we’ll have an interesting week. Albeit a short week, with a throwback of Zeke on Thursday!
