He was reportedly at work when his two-year-old accidentally shot his pregnant wife at their home. Authorities said that Alek called dispatchers to respond to the emergency at his residence and said that he “received a phone call from his wife, ‘screaming something about my son and needing to call 911.’”</p><p>In the wake of Ilg’s and her unborn child’s sudden and accidental death, Alek took to social media to share a heartwrenching tribute to his wife. “There are no words for the pain and loss I feel. She was, is, and will always be, the love of my life.” Officials revealed that the firearm used in the accidental shooting belonged to Alex and was mostly kept in a nightstand next to the couple’s bed.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Manuel Rocha: Former US ambassador arrested over accusations of secretly serving as agent for Cuba</a></p><p>Reports suggest that the two-year-old is still with Alek amid ongoing investigation about how the toddler managed to pull the trigger on the firearm.
