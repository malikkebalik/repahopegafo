Fans say he's 'more like the next Bruce Willis'</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Despite being named as one of the 100 most influential people in the world by Time magazine in 2020 and being placed at number 15 on 25 Greatest Actors of the 21st Century by The New York Times, social media users feel <a href=#>Michael B. Jordan</a> still has a long way to go when it comes to acting. The ‘Just Mercy’ star was trending all over the Internet after people dubbed him as the Denzel Washington of this generation.<br>&nbsp;<br>While only a few supported the actor, the majority of them agreed that Michael B. Jordan was definitely not a good actor but only a good-looking movie star. Social media users also did not hesitate to throw in a few suggestions as they named the late <a href=#>Chadwick Boseman</a> and the award-winning actor <a href=#>Mahershala Ali</a> as top choices if someone had to be compared to <a href=#>Denzel Washington.</a><br>&nbsp;<br><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong><br><a href=#>Michael B Jordan sets Valentine's day goals, Internet declares 'Lori Harvey won' after couple's aquarium date</a></p><p><a href=#>What is Denzel Washington's connection with Colombia's FARC rebels?

The recent trailer release of the same and a thread by a social media user sparked the entire debate of the comparison between the two.&nbsp; Jordan shot to fame with his action drama movies like ‘Fruitvale Station’ (2013), and ‘Creed’ (2015). He further got close to being an A-lister after he impressed the audience with his role of Erik Killmonger in Marvel’s ‘Black Panther’ released in 2018.&nbsp; Interestingly, all three were helmed by Ryan Coogler. After getting praised for ‘Creed II’, he will now be making his directorial debut with ‘Creed III’ in 2022.</p><p>Denzel Washington, on the other hand, boasts an illustrious career spanning more than four decades. The Hollywood icon has bagged two Academy Awards along with three Golden Golden Globe Awards, a Screen Actors Guild Award, and a Tony Award. In 2016, he was honored with the Cecil B. DeMille Lifetime Achievement Award and was named as the greatest actor of the 21st century in 2020 by the New York Times.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>‘There's really no comparison’ says social media</h2><p>Movie fanatics gave their two cents on the heated debate where one user stated, “Denzel Washington is a top level Major League actor. Michael B Jordan is a solid Minor League actor, which is fine but there's really no comparison.” Another user said, “Honestly it’s very disrespectful to mention Michael b Jordan in the same sentence as Denzel.” One tweeted, “Michael B Jordan stopped being attractive after Creed.”<br>&nbsp;<br>The next one shared, “No. he is a movie star but not an actor actor. we had chances with him and john David and Idris and Mahershala but it didn't work that way.” Meanwhile, one user claimed, “Jordan’s a bad actor. A more interesting debate is whether or not he’s smart off-camera. Always struck me as somebody who knows what to say but doesn’t totally know why he’s saying it, which makes me very interested in his vision for Creed III.” And, one persona sserted, “Michael B Jordan is more like the next Bruce Willis of this generation.” One user concluded while sharing a detailed insight, “I'm sorry but no he is not. I think the next Denzel of the generation would've been Chadwick. I think Michael B Jordan can act but he seems he can only act in a certain criteria, if that makes sense. Even Winston Duke has a bigger range than him and he's done less movies.”</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Denzel Washington is a top level Major League actor.
