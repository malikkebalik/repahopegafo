Ideally, the unsuccessful party should apply for a stay of execution after judgment is delivered from the court issuing the decree and if unsuccessful from the court to which the appeal is preferred,” said Justice Mativo.</p><p>The home was built in 2007 at a cost of Ksh299 million, according to Mr Maina.
