The 23-year-old mother stands accused of beating the 20-month-old to death before dumping his body at a Waste Management landfill, last October.</p><p>Leilani's lawyers have asked to remove certain charges, particularly <a href=# rel>malice murder</a> and felony murder, citing that the charges were unclear "and/or collectively fail to allege any manner of death." Other charges in the filing include multiple counts of making a false statement, false report of a crime, and concealing the death of another, according to the docs. Her lawyers also filed paperwork claiming the mother who set <a href=# rel>Georgia police</a> on a massive hunt 45 days before Quinton's body was recovered on November 18, had the right to not incriminate herself while she was being questioned by police.</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>'She was not a mother to him': Outrage as Quinton Simon's heartbreaking obituary calls Leilani 'survivor'</a></p><p><a href=# rel>Who is Henry Moss?

Leilani was arrested last November and entered a not-guilty plea to all 19 charges.</p><p>She remained the prime suspect in the case when she first reported her toddler son as missing from her house at Buckhalter Road on October 5 and later presumed dead on October 12. If the 23-year-old is released, she may be able to meet her legal team and view a crucial piece of video evidence that could be used against her while they prepare a case to be used in court, reported a criminal defense attorney.</p><h2 class=split>Police found 'an object' Leilani Simon allegedly used to beat Quinton</h2><p>Although it is unknown what evidence led to the arrest of the mother, it is believed to be "an object" Leilani used to beat Quinton that resulted in his death, according to an indictment seen by <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">WSAV</a>. Her bond was not set after an initial hearing as the judge present was not a superior court judge, reported the source. A scheduled hearing for an arraignment is expected to happen on March 23.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoqaWeu7W7zWaqoqWfo3quu8xmo56hnJa7qnnFoqOeq12pvG6wyKykoqujYrq2vsOeqWabmJa%2FqLHSZpifrJWneqOxyKeeZpmTmMK0scNmoKdlpKSxpbjEq6pmnJWWwak%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sean-riggs-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Sean Riggs Net Worth</span></a>
