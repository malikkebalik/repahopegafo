Approximately Sh30 million was blown for the said birthday event.</p><p><strong>Read:&nbsp;<a href=#>Kenyans Troll Sarah Kabu For Advising Kenyan Youth To Fundraise For Weddings</a></strong></p><p>The couple has been living large, from traveling to exotic places, building and buying new homes and dining in the best restaurants.</p><p>Reports reaching Kahawa Tungu reveal that the two have gone their separate ways, with Sarah decrying a toxic marriage.</p><p>Apparently, Sarah through her Whatsapp status made a post saying she had called it quits in her marriage while accusing her estranged husband of keeping their children away from her.</p><p>“For those who may not understand am done and dusted with him and thus why he took off with my kids under the care of one of his bastards,” a screenshot quoted by Mpasho reads.</p><p><strong>Read Also:&nbsp;<a href=#>Bonfire Adventures&amp;#8217; CEO Simon Kabu Accused Of Exploiting His Employees</a></strong></p><p>She added, “…how can you be forced to be in a toxic marriage because we are couple goals and to protect our business and its dependents at the cost of my life?
