The A-list actress/director kept a low profile with a set of dark sunglasses and a baseball cap pulled down closely around her head. She added a gray hoodie, black leggings and a pair of fresh Adidas sneakers for her outing in the tony town of Loa Angeles, which comes a day after it was reported Olivia is still <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>“very upset”</a> over her breakup with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Harry Styles</strong></a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/olivia-wilde-coffee-run-backgrid-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>“Olivia is still very much upset about the breakup,” a source told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Us Weekly</a>&nbsp;for its latest issue, published on Friday, December 9. “Olivia thought going on vacation would allow her to decompress,” the insider added, referring to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Olivia’s recent girls’ trip</a>. Olivia and Harry met on the set of their film<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Don’t Worry Darling&nbsp;</a>and began dating in December 2020 after Olivia’s split from Saturday Night Live&nbsp;alum&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jason Sudeikis.</strong></a></p><p id=content-paragraph-4>However, they <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>split</a> in November. And according to a source, neither were fully ready for it. “Harry will not say that they have broken up – just that they are taking a break and putting their relationship on pause,” a source told <strong>HollywoodLife</strong>&nbsp;EXCLUSIVELY for a November 23 report.&nbsp; “No one thinks that they will resume the relationship after his tour, but Harry says that he does not know what the future holds.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Meanwhile, Olivia recently got candid about the drama surrounding <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Don’t Worry Darling</a>, saying she was disappointed how her latest film became minimized due to it. With cast <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>firings</a>, an on-set feud, her romance with Harry and even “<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Spitgate”</a>&nbsp;making headlines for the psychological thriller, the mother of two had to deal with a pretty sizeable shadow cast over the production&nbsp;and herself&nbsp;when it opened last month. In a new interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Elle</a>, Olivia appeared to take it all in stride, calling the drama “untruths.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“It is shocking to see so many untruths about yourself traded as fact. This film is trying to ask big questions, but [it’s] ‘Let’s just focus on this sideshow over here,’” she explained.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ze5BpZqikmau2onnWoqOdnV2ovK27jJymn56Vmnqzwc1mo6irXZa7qLHLnqpmqJikwbC%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nick-cannon-siblings-getting-to-know-the-cannon-clan.html><span>←</span><span>Nick Cannon Siblings: Getting to Know the Cannon Clan</span></a>
