During his career, Alfonso made seven all-star appearances, and won four silver slugger awards.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Alfonso Soriano is, as of mid- 2017? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Soriano’s net worth is as high as $60 million, an amount earned through his successful career as a baseball player, which started in 1996 and ended in 2014.</p><h3>Alfonso Soriano Net Worth $60 Million</h3><p>Alfonso is of Haitian ancestry, through his father; his mother is Doña Andrea Soriano, the sister of Hilario Soriano, a baseball catcher who played for the Tigres del Licey. Growing up in the Dominican Republic, Alfonso started learning English in school, but most of his knowledge of the language came from films and TV series.</p><p>Before he started playing in the MLB, Alfonso spent a year in the Hiroshima Toyo Carp training camp for Dominican players. However, he was dissatisfied with the intense training, and hired Don Nomura, sports agent to help him negotiate his way out from Hiroshima Toyo Carp and move to MLB. Club officials were against him and made it difficult for Alfonso to sign with any MLB team. However, their attempt was unsuccessful and Alfonso became a part of the New York Yankees in 1998.</p><p>He joined the first squad in 1999 and played with them until 2003, and posted several notable results, including setting the record of 30 home runs and 30 stolen bases in 2002, and won his first Silver Slugger Award the same year. In 2003 he was traded to the Texas Rangers and immediately made an impact on the Rangers’ game, by having six hits in nine innings, in the victory against the Detroit Tigers. However, he was traded to the Washington Nationals in 2005, and while with the team, he posted a 40-40 game, becoming one of just four players to do so.</p><p>However, he had several contract disputes with the Nationals officials, and in 2006 he rejected a contract worth $70 million, so after unsuccessful talks, he signed a contract worth around $136 million over eight years with the Chicago Cubs, which increased his net worth to a large degree; the contract also included a no-trade clause. He switched to center field, but his performance didn’t decline, and he was once again selected for the All Star game, his sixth, and the following year, his seventh appearance.</p><p>However, from 2009 injuries began to trouble him, which caused his form to drop down, and although he bounced back in 2012 and 2013 seasons, he was traded to the New York Yankees, for which he played throughout the 2013 and 2014 season, after which he retired. Upon his retirement, Alfonso stated that he had lost love and passion for the game and that he wanted to fully focus on his wife and children.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Alfonso is married to Angelica with whom he has six children.</p><p>Alfonso is also a well-known philanthropist; he has donated over $2.5 million to the Dominican Republic for children who want to follow in his footsteps and become professional baseball players.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=8.4123134328358><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Alfonso Soriano</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$60 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Salary</td><td>18&nbsp;million USD</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>January 7, 1976</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>San Pedro de Macorís, Dominican Republic</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>6 ft (1.85 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>195 lbs (88.5 kg)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Baseball player</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>Dominican</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Carmen Isis Eusebio</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>Children</td><td>Allen Soriano, Alfonso Soriano Jr., Angel Soriano, Angeline Soriano, Alisis Soriano, Alisha Soriano</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Andrea Soriano</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Nicknames</td><td>阿方索·索利安諾 , Сориано, Альфонсо</td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1156443/</a></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Awards</td><td>Best Breakthrough Athlete ESPY Award</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=32><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=5><td>1</td><td>Traded to the Washington Nationals for Brad Wilkerson, Terrmel Sledge, and a player to be named.
