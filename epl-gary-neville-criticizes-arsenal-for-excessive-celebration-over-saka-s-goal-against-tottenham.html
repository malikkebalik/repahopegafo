Saka confidently placed his penalty shot down the middle of the goal, just out of reach of diving Guglielmo Vicario.
The 22-year-old player and his teammates, overwhelmed with excitement, celebrated vigorously at Emirates Stadium.
Unfortunately, their elation was short-lived when Tottenham swiftly responded with a goal, as James Maddison assisted Son Heung-min for his second goal of the match, ultimately resulting in a 2-2 draw."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
