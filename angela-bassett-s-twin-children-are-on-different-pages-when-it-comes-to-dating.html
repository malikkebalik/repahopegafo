Vance welcomed their twin children, Bronwyn Vance and Slater Vance, via surrogate.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The actress has always talked about her children and motherhood throughout her career. Despite being one of the most famous faces in Hollywood, she wanted&nbsp;to give her twin children a normal childhood.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>She revealed to <a href=# rel="follow noopener">Closer Weekly</a> that she instilled responsibility and gratitude in her kids early. “I had them making up beds at 18 months. I am not trying to get them to do anything.&nbsp;They are used to doing the right thing,” the 9-1-1 star jokingly told the outlet.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Bassett has also said that she sends her twin children to public school. She explained she went to public school, and she turned out fine, which meant&nbsp;her kids would also turn out fine.&nbsp;</p><h2>Angela Bassett’s Twin Children on Dating</h2><p>The actress'&nbsp;kids&nbsp;are now teenagers, and she has opened up about some adjustments she had to make while raising them.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>One major change was watching&nbsp;her children's love life. In May 2021, the actress spoke to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Us Weekly</a> about the experience.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>“My daughter asked if she could have a boyfriend, so she’s dating,” the 62-year-old told the outlet. “Sometimes, I’ll have the nerve to ask, ‘Have you kissed?’ And she says, ‘No.’ And I’m like, ‘Oh, OK, well, that wasn’t my journey."</p><p>Bassett added that during the coronavirus pandemic, the teen lovebirds had to “stay six feet apart and mask it.”&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Angela Bassett and her husband Courtney Vance volunteering&nbsp;with their twin children.&nbsp;</strong>(Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Meanwhile, her husband ensured their kids knew the importance of choosing a good partner and maintaining&nbsp;respect.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>But because the couple was new to this stage of parenthood, they found it a little awkward navigating their kids’ dating lives.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>As for their son, it was a different story. The actress jokingly revealed that as a tiny tot, he seemed interested in dating, but as a teenager, he just wanted to work on his music career.&nbsp;She added that Slater loved to write lyrics and rap, which was fine for her.&nbsp;</p><h2>Angela Bassett on Raising Her Teenagers</h2><p>Another new thing that the couple was introducing now that their twin children were teenagers was including them in the decision-making process.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Previously, it was strictly a no-negotiation policy, but since they turned 13, the parents had more <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">candid conversations</a> with the siblings.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>“We always said that from zero to 12, children need to hear us and actually do what we ask them to do, and then 13 on we have discussions. So we’re in the discussion phase now,” the father of two told Closer Weekly in November 2019.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>And if things did not go according to plan, Vance could away be counted on to maintain the structure and system in their household.&nbsp;</p><p>During an appearance on&nbsp;The Late Late Show with James Corden, the actress shared&nbsp;her husband was more of an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">authoritative figure</a> while she was a bit of a pushover. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Her husband was tough and consistent with the parenting, and she had to “guilt-trip them, pull things away, or leave the room” to get them to do anything.&nbsp;But it was all about maintaining that balance at the end of the day. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJmenLKtrYybmKyrlanBbsDWoqVmm5ieuaW%2BxKdloaydoQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-adam-pacman-jones-wife-ex-nfl-star-arrested-at-airport-in-kentucky-for-intoxication-and.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Adam 'Pacman' Jones' wife?
