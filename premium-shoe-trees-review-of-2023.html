For example, plastic shoe trees are only useful for keeping your shoes in shape, while wooden shoe trees can help absorb moisture. Here's a brief explanation of the different shoe tree materials:</span></p><ul><li><strong>Aromatic cedarwood:</strong> The best shoe trees are made from aromatic cedarwood. Cedarwood takes care of your shoe in different ways. First, it straightens out the leather and helps to smoothen creases. It also absorbs moisture from your shoes to help you stay fresh and comfortable all day. In addition, cedarwood also has a refreshing scent that clears away repulsive odor from your footwear. And finally, cedarwood helps to repel insects and moths from your shoes.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Natural wood:</strong> Shoe trees made from natural wood are easy to spot. They are good for most shoes, and they also help absorb moisture. However, they don’t offer the same refreshing scent as cedarwood.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Plastic:</strong> Shoe trees can also be made of plastic. However, we don't recommend them for leather shoes. The only advantage of plastic shoe trees is the cost and the lightweight design. For example, if you go on a trip and you need to get shoe trees urgently, plastic shoe trees are a perfect choice.</li></ul><h4><b>Size</b></h4><p><span>Exquisite shoes often come with perfectly-sized shoe trees on purchase. However, if you are getting shoe trees as a separate item, you must ensure that they fit your shoes. Ideally, the size of your shoe tree should be the same as your shoes.</span></p><h4><b>Type</b></h4><p><span>There are different shoe trees, and each of them has a unique design. Even though all shoe trees serve the same purpose, they are not the same. Some of the types and designs of shoe trees are discussed below:&nbsp;</span></p><ul><li><strong>Spring shoe trees:</strong> Spring shoe trees may be good for sneakers and shoes with wide fronts, but they are terrible for pointed and heel-toes shoes. They have a massive front, so pushing them down the heel of your shoes can be damaging.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Split-toe shoe trees:</strong> If you want to get a split-toe shoe tree, choose a size smaller than your normal shoe size. For example, if your shoe size is 45, get a size 43 shoe tree. Split-toe shoe trees are designed to mimic your toes, so you can easily adjust them within the shoe. However, they can stretch the shoe a little too much. Getting a smaller size to your shoes prevents this.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Full-toe shoe trees:</strong> Full-toe shoes are ideal for heel-toe shoes. They fit perfectly with the average shoe and are most effective if you’re looking for an affordable product. However, full-toe shoe trees cannot be adjusted like split-toe shoe trees.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Hollowed shoe trees:</strong> Hollowed shoe trees are one of the best shoe trees available. They are perfectly shaped and built to smoothen out every corner of your shoes. And even though they are made from wood, these shoes are extremely lightweight and, thus, perfect for travel.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Boot shoe trees:</strong> If you own bespoke or designer shoes, the shoe trees to match would be boot shoe trees. They are useful for super high-end footwear, and of course, you can also use them for regular shoes.</li></ul><h4><b>Purpose</b><b>&nbsp;</b></h4><p><span>Knowing why you need a shoe tree makes the selection process easier. So before you purchase any shoe tree, you should know its use case. For example, if you need travel shoe trees, get plastic shoe trees since they are much lighter. And if you want one for your office, get a shoe tree made from aromatic cedar; it'll take care of bad odor and remove moisture.&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Tips for Using a Shoe Tree</h3><h4><b>Use it for 24 hours</b></h4><p><span>If you want to get the best out of your shoe tree, use it for 24 hours and then remove it. This time is more than enough for aromatic cedar shoe trees to smoothen your shoe, absorb all moisture and leave a refreshing scent. Of course, if the shoe trees come with the shoe, you can leave them in for as long as you want.</span></p><h4><b>Use wooden shoe trees for moist shoes</b></h4><p><span>If you just want to straighten your footwear, you can use a plastic shoe tree. However, use a wooden shoe tree if you want to remove moisture.&nbsp;</span></p><h4><b>Keep the plastic ones away from heavy pressure and impact</b></h4><p><span>Plastic shoe trees are not strong, so they can break easily. This is why you need to take great caution when using them, by ensuring that they don't fall or feel excess pressure.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b>Summary</b></h3><p><span>Shoe trees are important for shoe care, and everybody should have a few of these at home.

We have already shown you some of the best shoe trees in 2022, and you can easily make your pick.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGipnq6ZmsRwss6oq7Cdkad8tLTOnmStqpWafA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./know-the-relationship-status-and-net-worth-of-wpix-anchor-and-host-tamsen-fadal.html><span>←</span><span>Know the Relationship Status and Net Worth of WPIX Anchor and Host, Tamsen Fadal</span></a>
