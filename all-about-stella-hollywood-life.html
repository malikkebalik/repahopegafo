She simply told followers to shop at fashion brand LINE OF ONE to grab one like it. But her stunning good looks, trim model figure and flat abs caused the snapshot to go viral. There’s a good reason she’s gorgeous, as it’s in the genes.

Today Dakota, 31, and Stella are close, and were seen <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>grabbing green smoothies together</a> in L.A. in 2019.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Stella-Banderas-Melanie-Griffith-Antonio-Daughter-mega-post.jpg><h2>Stella Is A Cover Model</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>She graced the cover of Glamour Spain for their Sept. 2020 issue.
