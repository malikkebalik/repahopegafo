Two days later, she shared her official tribute about the death of her&nbsp;Jessie&nbsp;co-star after his family confirmed he passed away from a seizure due to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>his epilepsy</a>: “This ripped me up. I keep trying and I can’t make anything make sense. He was blameless, and relentlessly joyful; he was good. Through and through, Cam is good, in all ways and to all people. And the most alive. It’s wrong. I am so confused and devastated and angry. But that isn’t very Cam. He’d cast any shade of sadness or darkness in colors of positivity; he couldn’t help himself but to always leave you smiling, or laughing, or dancing. So sincere, kid Truth. He was good.” In addition to acknowledging Cameron’s parents <strong>Victor</strong> and <strong>Libby</strong>, Debby also reflected on their “Jessie family” — you can read her full tribute below.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3><strong>ORIGINAL STORY</strong>:&nbsp;<strong>Debby Ryan</strong>, 26, and the rest of Hollywood are mourning the tragic loss of <strong>Cameron Boyce</strong>, who passed away suddenly in his sleep on July 6. The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>20-year-old actor</a> suffered a seizure that was due to an ongoing medical condition he was getting treatment for before his death. Debby,&nbsp;who was his co-star on the hit Disney Channel series Jessie, responded to his death by posting a video of Cameron giving a speech on her Instagram Story. “It’s crazy. We can tweet whatever we want and we can use social media and Instagram and make the world a better place instead of a worse one, which so many people use it for,” Cameron said in his speech at the Thirst Project’s 9th Annual Thirst Gala in 2018. “But we need to use our resources and what we have… we’re all in here wearing suits. We need to use what we have to make the world a better place for other people… other people, people who need us!”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>In addition to acting, Cameron was incredibly passionate about helping others. His speech that Debby reposted shows that. At the Thirst Gala, he was honored with The Pioneering Spirit Award. He raised more $30,000 for the Thirst Project to build two wells in Swaziland. Debby has not released any other statement yet. The actress did change her Instagram profile pic after Cameron’s death from one of herself to a photo of what looks like clouds in the sky.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Debby and Cameron’s fellow <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Jessie co-stars</a> posted their own tributes in the hours after his tragic death was announced. <strong>Peyton List</strong>, 21, who played Cameron’s older sister on Jessie, wrote a heartbreaking Instagram message. “I can barely see my eyes anymore from crying so hard,” Peyton wrote. “Cameron, I love you with every ounce of me, and I thank you for the time I had with you, being in my life, and being my brother forever and always,” List wrote. “There is a hole in my heart that will never heal left for you. I will never stop talking about you.”</p><a href=# rel=nofollow readability=1><p>View this post on Instagram</p></a><p><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>This ripped me up.

My heart is with his parents, Vic and Libby, full of grace, and his wonderful sister Maya. An unimaginable sorrow. I’m grateful for our Jessie family, with whom to uniquely grieve our guy — Peyton, Skai, Kevin and Karan, whose soul is also far too special to have to experience this depth of grief. There are beautiful connections and beams of light, ever present, truly the fingerprints of Cam still around and showing up in the midst of this. I love him so much. Forever. You’re alive in the legacy of love you built, and I will keep that light burning in me for the rest of my journey. The world was robbed. We’re better for you.</a></p><p>A post shared by <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Debby Ryan</a> (@debbyryan) on Jul 10, 2019 at 5:44pm PDT</p><p id=content-paragraph-8><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://twitter.com/CUTMYLIlP/status/1148065258852028420</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-9><strong>Skai Jackson</strong>, 17, who played Zuri Ross on Jessie, posted: “I don’t even know where to start… I am at a loss for words,” Skai began her caption on the post. “I never thought in a million years I would be writing this.
