As of November 2021, her YouTube channel has over 17.5 million subscribers and over 2.54 billion views.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Aside from regular skits, Koshy also does vlogs and her own YouTube series named Liza On Demand. She is loved by her fans for her sense of humor and well-executed comedy videos.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Koshy has made hundreds of videos, including parodies where she plays multiple characters. One such parody she did is titled “WHY I TATTOOED MY ENTIRE BODY.”</p><h2>Does Liza Koshy Have Tattoos?</h2><p>Because of the video, many people began wondering if Koshy really had any tattoos. In a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Wired autocomplete</a> video where she answered the web’s most searched questions about herself, she spoke on whether she had any tattoos.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Koshy points at a tiny black mark on her nose and answers: <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Yes. I actually have a tattoo on my nose. Can you zoom in? Can you see that? That little like dash on my nose. My friend was getting a tattoo, and I wanted to send a picture to my mom and pretend I was getting a tattoo on my face. And the tattoo artist accidentally moved and nicked my nose.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The YouTuber then continued to reveal the truth, admitting that she had made up the answer on the spot. “That was a complete lie. I don’t have any tattoos.”</p><p>Koshy had also shared about being too scared to get a tattoo beforehand. In an Instagram post she made in December 2015, she uploaded a picture of a hand with the words “a tattoo” written in gold ink.</p><p>Koshy wrote in the captions: i got “a tattoo” ! Kidding - this is my friend's hand. I was too scared to get it. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKSZr65ut86sn7JlpJbBtbvOZ5%2BtpZw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dianne-lennon.html><span>←</span><span>Dianne Lennon</span></a>
