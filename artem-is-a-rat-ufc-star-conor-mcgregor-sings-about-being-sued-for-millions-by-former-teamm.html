I was the person who came up with the idea to do a whiskey for Conor,” Lobov said.</p><p>“Once the deal was ready, I went to Conor and I said, ‘Conor, I have the deal ready for you. This is going to be a billion-dollar deal, no messing here.’ I’m not sure if he took me seriously or not at the time with the billion dollars.</p><p>“We continued working on it and as you can see it was a massive success. I’m really happy to see that and I’m really happy to be a part of it.”</p><p>Lobov claims to have rejected a $1million [£840,000] offer from McGregor for his help but refused to reveal if he had made any money from the wildly successful whiskey brand.</p><p>“Conor offered me $1m but I turned it down, I didn’t accept it. You know, throughout my career whenever I have helped Conor with camps, he offered to pay me for them camps, but I never accepted money from him,” he added.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/03/McGregorLobov1.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/02/GettyImages-1045714466-1.jpg><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in MMA</h2></p><p>“I said, ‘we’ve always been friends and helped each other. I never paid you for my camps so I’m not gonna accept money from you for my camps either.’</p><p>“With the whiskey, there was a bit more to the story about how that went about and what happened, but I don’t want to share that yet…I turned down $1million and didn’t accept the deal.”</p><p>In April 2021, ‘Notorious’&nbsp;and two other investors&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sold their stakes&nbsp;</a>in Proper 12 for $600million [£503million] and the former dual-weight UFC champion became the richest man in sport as a result.</p><p>Earlier this week, <a href=#>Lobov initiated High Court</a> action and is claiming that an agreement existed that entitled him to five per cent of the&nbsp;<a href=#>$180million [£151million]</a>&nbsp;McGregor made from the sale.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/08/Screenshot-2022-08-02-101431.jpg><p>After days of silence, ‘Notorious’ took to social media on Saturday evening with an uncomplimentary song about his former friend who is taking him to court.</p><p>“Artem is a rat, na na na na! Hey! Na na, na na! Hey! Artem is a rat, na na na na. Hey! Rat,” McGregor chanted.</p><p>Away from business drama, the biggest star in MMA history is currently gearing up for his eagerly anticipated UFC comeback after being sidelined due to injury since July 2021.</p><p>McGregor has&nbsp;<a href=#>seriously bulked up&nbsp;</a>during his time away from the sport and is expected to attempt a welterweight title run when he returns in 2023.</p><p>The 34-year-old says he <a href=#>will complete two tests </a>with the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) in February and look to book a fight in the division that is home to Jorge Masvidal, Kamaru Usman, and champion Leon Edwards.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaG4tLzOq6tnm5%2BifLS8zquraKWdlnxyfpRxbG1tX5i8r7vRZqScn6KatLC%2BjKygp5%2BjYq6zwMSmZKWnkqTDbrzRqKeeql1mf264wLCqrqGkZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./wiki-and-bio-on-blake-patrick-anderson-from-vampire-academy-the-talks-today.html><span>←</span><span>Wiki and Bio on Blake Patrick Anderson From Vampire Academy The Talks Today</span></a>
