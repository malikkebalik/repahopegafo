class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>“The Curse” is a song that tells a story. It starts with the discovery of a long-lost mummy in Egypt, which is then shipped to New York City to be displayed in a museum. The narrator of the song is a rich and powerful man who is obsessed with the mummy, seeing it as his ticket to fame and fortune. However, as the song progresses, it becomes clear that the mummy is cursed. The narrator starts to experience strange and unsettling events, which he initially dismisses as coincidences.
