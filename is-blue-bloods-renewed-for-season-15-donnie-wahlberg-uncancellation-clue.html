Several cast members have sparked speculation that the show could potentially be saved and fans have even started a petition urging CBS to reverse its decision. Keep reading to see <a href=# rel=noopener>if Blue Bloods is renewed for Season 15</a>.</p><p>CBS’&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Blue Bloods</a> is a popular police procedural that focuses on the fictional Reagan family, who have a long history with law enforcement. The series first premiered in September 2010 and has anchored CBS’ Friday night lineup ever since. It is the network’s most-watched primetime program and the No. 3 broadcast drama with 9.54 million viewers, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Deadline</a>. The ensemble cast includes Tom Selleck as New York City Police Commissioner Frank Reagan, Donnie Wahlberg as Danny Reagan, Will Estes as Jamie Reagan, Bridget Moynahan as Erin Reagan-Boyle and Len Cariou as Henry Reagan, among others.</p><p>After 13 seasons on air, CBS announced in November 2023 that the show will end with Season 14. The two-part final season will consist of 18 episodes; the first eight are currently airing, while the remaining 10 will premiere in fall 2024.</p><p>“Blue Bloods will forever be a beloved part of CBS’s legacy. It ruled Friday nights with unprecedented dominance since its premiere and established itself as a pillar of our winning lineup with an exceptionally devoted fan base,” Amy Reisenbach, President of CBS Entertainment, and David Stapf, President of CBS Studios, said in a statement at the time.</p><p>Since the announcement, fans and cast members alike have been rallying around the show in hopes that it can be saved. Read on to see if Blue Bloods is really ending with Season 14.</p><h2>Is Blue Bloods renewed for Season 15?</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Blue-Bloods-1.jpg alt="Blue Bloods" width=1203 height=702 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Is Blue Bloods renewed for Season 15? Although it’s unlikely that Blue Bloods will get another full season, it’s not impossible. There are also rumors swirling that the show will at least get a few more episodes.</p><p>While appearing on&nbsp;SiriusXM’s&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-ml-dynamic=true data-ml-dynamic-type=sl data-orig-url=https://www.siriusxm.com/player/show/entity/94333a54-027c-dd2e-7f56-6be63dccc7fa data-ml-id=0 data-ml=true data-xid=fr1710172866663cjf data-skimlinks-tracking=xid:fr1710172866663cjf data-written=true>Andy Cohen Live</a> (via&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a>), Donnie Wahlberg referred to Season 14 as “allegedly” and “potentially” the last season. “There are rumblings, so we’ll see what happens,” he teased.</p><p>Wahlberg’s remarks come shortly after his co-star Tom Selleck voiced his opinion on the show’s cancellation. “CBS will find an awful lot of people aren’t ready to say goodbye to it,” he told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">TV Insider</a> during a January 2024 interview. “The show’s more popular than ever, and I think [numbers] will increase with the interest this year.” He added: “We’re certainly not out of ideas.”</p><p>“I’m not counting the days so I can do something else,” Selleck continued. “I love the work. Sometimes the hours are a little harder because I’m older, but so what? I want work as long as they’ll have me.”</p><p>Blue Bloods mainstay Gregory Jbara, who stars NYPD Deputy Commissioner of Public Information Garrett Moore, also weighed in on the debate while speaking to the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Think Big</a> podcast. “I don’t want to get any anyone’s hopes up, but if our numbers are really good … I know that there’s a push to try and flesh out the back half,” he said. As it stands now, the show will end with 293 episodes. Extending the final season into Spring 2025 would allow the series to hit the impressive 300 episodes milestone and then some.</p><p>“Tom [Selleck]’s got something going on,” Jbara claimed. “He literally goes, ‘I’ve got a couple tricks in my bag that I’m going to present to the network.’’ Jbara added: “I think I can say without teasing anyone that that is a something that’s being considered.”</p><p>Fans are also putting up a fight and urging the network to either rethink the cancellation or order seven more episodes so the show can hit the 300 mark. The Twitter account <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">@SaveBlueBloods</a> has been leading the effort, advocating for CBS to “Cancel the Cancel.” The account frequently urges fans to tweet about the series to get it trending and it has also launched an online petition on Change.org (You can view and sign that&nbsp;petition by<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"> clicking here</a>). The petition currently has over 14,ooo signatures, just shy of its 15,000 goal. Its description reads: “It was mere moments ago when us fans got the news that Blue Bloods was getting axed after 14 seasons. While it has been on for a long time, it still has so much to offer and explore. Spread this everywhere! Use the hashtag #SaveBlueBloods. Let your voices be heard!”</p><p>On March 15, #SaveBlueBloods became one of the Top 5 trending topics on Twitter. Wahlberg commended fans for the feat, re-tweeting a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">screenshot of the rankings</a> and writing: “You all never cease to amaze.”</p><p>CBS has not yet responded to the petition nor has it reversed its decision, so fans will just have to keep up their efforts!</p><p>Blue Bloods&nbsp;airs on Fridays at 10 p.m. on CBS and streams on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Paramount+</a>.</p><p><strong>Get to know the <a href=# rel=noopener>Reagan family</a> in the gallery below.&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmrKeRpcBwusSwqmhvYmaAc4COm6OunV2XubC7w6xkq52emsSmsI4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./herschel-walker-s-mental-health-condition-caused-the-end-of-his-marriage-with-wife-cindy.html><span>←</span><span>Herschel Walkers Mental Health Condition Causedthe End of His Marriage with Wife Cindy</span></a>
