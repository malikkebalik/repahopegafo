He was in basketball and golf teams during his school and college days and graduated in 1981 with a degree in Radio and Television Broadcasting. He joined CBS in the capacity of a collegiate sports studio host in 1985. Jim used to also comment on golf events. In 1988, he became a commentator for Westwood One which was a CBS radio division’s subsidiary.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Jn.jpg><p>He got multiple promotions and awards and in 1998 became the host of The NFL Today. And soon he was the network’s main play-by-play announcer. He covers NFL, NCAA and also golf for CBS. And recently, he was at the PGA event in Toronto, Canada where the Canadian Nick Taylor won the title. It was Nick’s third win in a row and he became the first Canadian to win the RBC Canadian Open since 1954. And Jim’s great energy totally matched with that of the moment. He was totally fired up too.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Jim_retiring></span>Is Jim retiring?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In April 2023, <a href=#>Jim</a> decided to stop calling for college sports. He said he wants to devote time to his family now. Soon, a rumor spread that Jim is retiring from commentary. He cleared the air when he said:</p><p>“I’m not retiring. I’ve still got about 40 weeks a year to cover the NFL, the Super Bowl and golf for another dozen years or so.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Jngd.jpg><p>On the occasion of stepping down from college sports coverage, Jim added:</p><p>“It’s a celebration of people I had the great fortune of working with and the people I got to know on the road to the Final Four all these years. The players, the coaches, the NCAA committee members. It’s a big world out there in college basketball and I have had a little bit to do with the voice and the documenting of some of its biggest moments.”</p><p>For those who are not aware, Jim had two marriages and one divorce.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jim%E2%80%99s_family_life_marriages_children_divorce></span>Jim’s family life, marriages, children, divorce<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jim married <a href=#>Ann-Lorraine “Lorrie” Carlsen</a> in 1983. They resided at Westport in Connecticut at that time and Ann-Lorraine has one child, a daughter named Caroline with him. But the marriage collapsed and they filed for divorce in 2009. In November 2009, the court ordered Jim to pay his ex-wife USD 9,16,000 per year in child support and alimony. This was <a href=#>the costliest divorce settlement at that time.</a> And Jim was earning USD 7 million in those years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Jnfn.jpg><p>Before the divorce finalized, Jim had already begun dating 29 year old <a href=#>Courtney Richards</a>. But Courtney was not the reason of the break of his first marriage. The court too confirmed it.</p><p>Three years later on 9 June 2012, Jim wed Courtney. The marriage ceremony was at the Pebble Beach Golf Links in Pebble Beach, California, at the tee of the course’s famous seventh hole. The couple has a daughter born in 2014 and a son who arrived in 2016.</p><p>Earlier, they resided at a house that overlooked the Pebble Beach Links. At its backyard was a replica of the seventh hole at Pebble Beach. Celebrities and golf enthusiasts used to frequent the place. Those who managed to make a hole-in-one had their names on a rock that stood next to the tee box. But he has now relocated to Nashville, Tennessee with his family.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Short_bio_on_Jim_Nantz></span>Short bio on Jim Nantz<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jim Nantz is a famous American sports commentator. <a href=#>More bio…</a></p><p>Share this</p><strong>Disclaimer Statement</strong>: Married Biography's editors wrote and updated all of this data based on their best knowledge and understanding. <a href=#>Married Biography</a> does not guarantee these opinions or ideas.
