Van Jefferson, Devon Achane or Kenneth Gainwell? — Mark J.</strong></p><p>Drop Kenneth Gainwell. He has the most competition for timeshare.</p><p><strong>Juwan Johnson or Dalton Kincaid? — Brian R.</strong></p><p>Juwan Johnson.</p><p><strong>Ten-team PPR league: George Pickens, Zay Flowers or Zach Charbonnet for my Week 1 flex? — Marc L.</strong></p><p>Zay Flowers for Week 1.</p><p class="slug ad-slug">Advertisement</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">TE swap</h2><p><strong>Should I drop Texans TE Dalton Schultz for Saints TE Juwan Johnson? — Anonymous</strong></p><p>Yes, I would.</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">A good problem to have</h2><span><span></span><img alt="A good problem to have" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theathletic.com/data:image/gif;base64 decoding=async data-nimg=responsive style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p class="sc-b636adb0-0 sc-f3dd6d06-23 fwmDuZ jeCHEZ">(Photo: Nick Cammett / Diamond Images via Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Diontae Johnson or Jahan Dotson? — Jackson S.</strong></p><p>You did a great job drafting when you have problems like this.</p><p>In the long run, I have Steelers WR Diontae Johnson ahead of Commanders WR Jahan Dotson, but this week give me Dotson. Any time I can try and avoid San Francisco coach Kyle Shanahan and the 49ers defense, I’m going to; especially with Nick Bosa back.</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">To drop or not to drop</h2><p><strong>Drop Skyy Moore for Jayden Reed? — Brian D.</strong></p><p>I’m firmly on the don’t-drop-Skyy-Moore side of things, but Jayden Reed’s on a short list of players making me reconsider. Since Moore played already, you can’t drop him so you have the luxury of seeing Reed in action. He would have to dominate two-wide sets and earn targets. To quote an earlier response in this blog, “I was pretty high on Skyy Moore but let’s be real. The Chiefs are not the Chiefs without Travis Kelce. Missing a superstar tight end that commands attention the way he does has ramifications.”</p><p>My point being I don’t want to judge Moore too strictly until Kansas City is at full strength.</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">Waddle vs. Lockett</h2><span><span></span><img alt="Waddle vs. Lockett" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theathletic.com/data:image/gif;base64 decoding=async data-nimg=responsive style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p><strong>Who to flex between Jaylen Waddle or Tyler Lockett in a full-PPR league? — Brian H.</strong></p><p>Don’t overthink this one. You paid a premium for Dolphins WR Jaylen Waddle and Miami is heading into the highest projected total on the slate. Seahawks WR Tyler Lockett’s good but also has way more competition for targets.</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">Last but not least</h2><p><strong>Who should I choose for my final bench spot? Nico Collins, Rashod Bateman, Tyjae Spears, De’Von Achane or Sam LaPorta? — Lucy H.</strong></p><p>Whenever you’re deciding on players you don’t have to start, it’s OK to stay solely focused on ceiling outcomes. I want shares of Baltimore WR Rashod Bateman and the Raven offense while they’re available.</p><p class="slug ad-slug">Advertisement</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">Zach Charbonnet's fantasy worth</h2><span><span></span><img alt="Zach Charbonnet's fantasy worth" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theathletic.com/data:image/gif;base64 decoding=async data-nimg=responsive style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p class="sc-b636adb0-0 sc-f3dd6d06-23 fwmDuZ jeCHEZ">(Photo: Stacy Revere / Getty Images)</p><p><strong>What is the value of a guy like Zach Charbonnet right now, listed No. 3 on Seattle’s depth chart?</strong></p><p>Don’t believe everything you read, I feel pretty confident that Charbonnet is the clear backup in Seattle. If he’s available he’s worth rostering for contingency value, even though I wouldn’t necessarily start him yet.</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">Williams for the win</h2><p><strong>Dalvin Cook or Jamaal Williams? — Patrick K.</strong></p><p>One-hundred percent Jamaal Williams. Breece Hall is off the injury report for the Jets, plus the Bills are easily the tougher defense. Alvin Kamara and Kendre Miller are out and Williams projects as a true bellcow for the first few weeks.</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">QB battle</h2><p><strong>Is it worth starting Geno Smith as QB on W1 over Justin Herbert? — Niko K</strong></p><p>No way, you want as much exposure to that game as possible and Justin Herbert’s at the center of it. Miami’s banged up in the secondary as well.</p><p>I’m starting Herbert.</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">Who to choose on D?</h2><p><strong>Jaguars or Falcons dst? — Taner B.</strong></p><p>Jags by a mile, they’re more talented and have a better matchup.</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">Mark Andrews inactive for Week 1</h2><span><span></span><img alt="Mark Andrews inactive for Week 1" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theathletic.com/data:image/gif;base64 decoding=async data-nimg=responsive style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p class="sc-b636adb0-0 sc-f3dd6d06-23 fwmDuZ jeCHEZ">(Photo: Scott Taetsch / Getty Images)</p><p>Baltimore Ravens tight end Mark Andrews is out for the team’s season opener against the Houston Texans on Sunday as he deals with a quad injury, the team announced Sunday.</p><p>Andrews was listed as questionable on the Ravens’ injury report Friday. The 28-year-old was limited in practice this week and missed workouts the week prior.</p><p>What does this means for the Ravens?</p><p>You don’t want to be dismissive of Andrews’ absence. He is Lamar Jackson’s favorite target and one of the best players in the league at his position. However, the Ravens enter the season with one of the better receiving corps that they’ve ever had. They also have two young pass-catching tight ends in Isaiah Likely and Charlie Kolar. Likely played well last year in games where Andrews was sidelined. They have plenty of weapons to pick up the slack.</p><a href=# data-amp-replace=CLIENT_ID class="sc-f3dd6d06-16 jkrWUg" readability=1><p class="sc-f3dd6d06-18 jMggnu">GO FURTHER</p><p class="sc-f3dd6d06-19 gXOwpd">Mark Andrews out vs. Texans with quad injury: Why Ravens are smart to play the long game</p></a><p class="slug ad-slug">Advertisement</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">Pick two, sit two</h2><p><strong>Need two more for flex from D. Hopkins, M. Evans, J. Williams, B. Hall, C. Sutton. — Es</strong></p><p>From a projection standpoint, I have Broncos WR Courtland Sutton as a sure thing until I can answer the questions I have for the rest. Do the Titans pass enough to support Titans WRs Treylon Burks and DeAndre Hopkins? Can Bucs QB Baker Mayfield get the ball downfield to WR Mike Evans with missing pieces on the offensive line? How much of the workload (especially in the red zone) will Jets RB Breece Hall command?</p><p>If the “J. Williams” is Jamaal Williams and not Javonte Williams, I’d start the Saints’ RB. These next three weeks should see him as an absolute bellcow for New Orleans.</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">Man vs. Machine</h2><p><strong>JSN or Zay Jones at flex? — Brian H.</strong></p><p>To my surprise, projections are in consensus against my instinct and saying to start Jaguars WR Zay Jones. I’d argue Seahawks WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba is also the third passing option but has the higher ceiling on a team with a similarly projected team total.</p><p>Let’s call this one man versus machine. I’d buck projections, especially if I’m behind after TNF.</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">Pros for starting Courtland Sutton</h2><span><span></span><img alt="Pros for starting Courtland Sutton" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theathletic.com/data:image/gif;base64 decoding=async data-nimg=responsive style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p class="sc-b636adb0-0 sc-f3dd6d06-23 fwmDuZ jeCHEZ">(Photo: Loren Elliott / Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Courtland Sutton or George Pickens (half-PPR league)? Thanks very much! — Peter S.</strong></p><p>Courtland Sutton for me based on camp hype, Bronco WR injuries, projections and the matchup. Lastly to quote myself from earlier in this blog, “George Pickens generally runs deeper routes which take time to develop that I doubt the 49ers' defense will be allowing.”</p><p>I think Pickens and the Steelers will be good this year, I’m just throttling expectations against Kyle Shanahan.</p><p>And thank you, Peter!</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">SuperFlex suggestions</h2><span><span></span><img alt="SuperFlex suggestions" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theathletic.com/data:image/gif;base64 decoding=async data-nimg=responsive style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p class="sc-b636adb0-0 sc-f3dd6d06-23 fwmDuZ jeCHEZ">(Photo: Michael Owens / Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Jahan Dotson or Samaje Perine as a flex in a 12-team SuperFlex league? What are your thoughts on Bryce young as a second QB in SuperFlex? — Daniel R.</strong></p><p>I would’ve thought the answer was Samaje Perine two weeks ago, until we found out Javonte Williams is made of adamantium. After Williams’ usage in the preseason, I have to agree with projections and assume an even split in regards to touches. I’m starting Jahan Dotson. He’s put the league on notice again this preseason and I see him as one of the next great young WRs. Washington’s in a plus matchup versus the hapless Arizona Cardinals and getting back Terry McLaurin at less than 100 percent could actually benefit Dotson.</p><p>I always draft SuperFlex quarterbacks in two of the first three rounds so I wouldn’t be in the position to start a rookie, but it’s too late for that now. Start Bryce Young while you must but keep a keen eye on the waiver wire for anyone else with a job and a pulse.</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">Go long</h2><p><strong>Flex Khalil Herbert or George Pickens in a half-PPR league with big distance scoring bonuses? — H.G.</strong></p><p>I’m starting Khalil Herbert over George Pickens mostly for the defensive matchup.</p><p>Pickens generally runs deeper routes which take time to develop that I doubt the 49er defense will be allowing. On the flip side, Herbert’s in a close divisional game with a one-point spread and a favorable game script; even if Justin Fields hogs some of the carries.</p><p class="slug ad-slug">Advertisement</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">Concerns over Justin Fields’ progression as a pocket passer and how they affect DJ Moore</h2><p><strong>Who would you start as flex this week? DJ Moore or James Cook? — Kapil S.</strong></p><p>I had to go to the videotape and check my different projections for this one. They’re only about a single point apart but I do have consensus to play James Cook over DJ Moore. I mentioned previously in this blog how I’m having serious concerns regarding Justin Fields’ progression as a pocket passer, so my gut’s in agreement as well.</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">Which RB has the highest upside</h2><span><span></span><img alt="Which RB has the highest upside" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theathletic.com/data:image/gif;base64 decoding=async data-nimg=responsive style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p class="sc-b636adb0-0 sc-f3dd6d06-23 fwmDuZ jeCHEZ">(Photo: Stacy Revere / Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Which of the ACL timeshare RBs (Javonte Williams/Samaje Perine and Breece Hall/Dalvin Cook) would you start this week, if any? — Trevor M.</strong></p><p>The easy way out is “it depends,” but it does. There are strong cases to start all four of those RBs, depending on the circumstance. That said, it’s more a statement on the current state of the RB2 landscape than anything.</p><p>Denver projects to split work right down the middle with anyone’s guess on the goal line. However, in New York, Breece Hall is off the injury report and would be my top choice of the four. He can do the most with limited touches. Especially in a case where the Jets fall behind Buffalo on Monday Night, Hall’s proficiency in the receiving game could earn him the snap share we’re after.</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">Flex options</h2><p><strong>Who to flex in a 10 team standard between Drake London, Elijah Moore, Breece Hall, Jordan Addison, Marvin Mims or Nico Collins? — Mike B.</strong></p><p>So much potential! Projections are as close as can be, so I’d start Marvin Mims based on a combination of matchup plus target share.</p><p>Load more updates</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57y6KtnmWSobyov46fmKeskajGbrLOqKubmZyherixxKRkamWRmcOqr8RokaWxeHm2dMKtjZ2hZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./edwards-jaden-ivey-and-jalen-duren-made-this-pistons-season-worth-it.html><span>←</span><span>Edwards: Jaden Ivey and Jalen Duren made this Pistons season worth it</span></a>
