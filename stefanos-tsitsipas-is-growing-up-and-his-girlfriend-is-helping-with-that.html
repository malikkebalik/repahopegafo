"I’m not a boy anymore. When I turned 21, I felt like, you know, things have changed." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The interview also brought into light his post-match press conference from&nbsp;last year, where Tsitsipas confessed that he sometimes felt like his parents were too&nbsp;involved in his life.</p><p>Surprisingly, his mother&nbsp;Julia Apostoli, a former&nbsp;professional tennis player,&nbsp;showed up&nbsp;at his next press conference and&nbsp;playfully tossed a question from the back row, saying,</p><p>Hi, Stef; now I’m following you to the press conference to make sure I’m aware how you feel.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Just in case you didn't know, Tsitsipas was born in a <a href=# rel=follow>tennis</a> family, with his mother being a former WTA player, while his father Apostolos Tsitsipas is trained as a tennis coach. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>But with what&nbsp;Tsitsipas said, he wants his parents to be less concerned about him&nbsp;since he hopes to explore his life independently.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Finding Time for Graphic Design</h2><p>While the former world No. 1 junior talked about trying new hobbies, he also shared one with the publication. He disclosed that he&nbsp;was finding time to get into graphic design and creating his own font.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Addressing how unusual it is for a professional athlete of his caliber to invest time in&nbsp;extracurricular talents and sundry passions, he said the growth in him starts from outside the tennis court, and "then&nbsp;it goes into my tennis." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Girlfriend&nbsp;Upgraded His Wardrobe</h2><p>In between learning new things and performing day in&nbsp;day out on the&nbsp;tennis court,&nbsp;Tsitsipas also makes time for his girlfriend&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Theodora Petalas</a>,&nbsp;a New York University alum. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Despite having a long-distance relationship, he credited his girlfriend, whom he has known&nbsp;for the last three years, for helping to pick new outfits for him.</p><p>"My wardrobe was quite weak, and I didn’t have a game there," he told Vogue. "I wanted to start dressing up a bit, so we tried to create an identity."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Now, with her help, he believes he has an improved wardrobe, filled with "earthy colors,"&nbsp;not&nbsp;too flashy, and&nbsp;refined but youthful outfits.</p><p>He further said he&nbsp;had started investing more&nbsp;in fashion lately, with the help of his girlfriend, and that&nbsp;transition&nbsp;benefitted him a lot and made him feel better about himself.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKukmrOius6sZK2rmanAqrzArGSgoaKhs7O1xKebZqiRp7KvwNJnn62lnA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nicki-minaj-ice-spice-take-you-to-barbie-world-in-new-song-hollywood-life.html><span>←</span><span>Nicki Minaj &amp;amp; Ice Spice Take You To Barbie World In New Song Hollywood Life</span></a>
