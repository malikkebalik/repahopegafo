While information about her parents eluded public scrutiny, a few pieces of information about her parents became public.</p><p>Her father, who was well-known in the paranormal community, passed on his passion to his daughter. According to Amy’s interviews, her father used to take her to houses around town that he claimed were haunted.</p><p>Amy’s mother, on the other hand, was mentioned in several publications as a writer. Apart from a few Instagram posts, very little is known about her. Amy’s mother has leiomyosarcoma. Regrettably, she died peacefully in October 2018.</p><p>Amy Bruni grew up with her two sisters.</p><h2><span id=Bruni_Amy_Height_Weight_and_Distinct_Characteristics>Bruni, Amy Height, Weight, and Distinct Characteristics</span></h2><p><strong>Amy Bruni stands at a height of 5 feet 6 inches (1.68 meters).</strong> Additionally, <strong>her weight was listed as 67 kilograms (147 pounds)</strong> but has fluctuated over time.</p><p>Additionally, the ginger-haired beauty has freckles on her face and around her nose, as well as blue eyes, which give the unique features that set her apart from the crowd.</p><h2><span id=Social_Media_Instagram_Facebook_and_Twitter><span class="TextRun SCXW105787335 BCX8" lang=en-us xml:lang=EN-US data-contrast=auto><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW105787335 BCX8" data-ccp-parastyle="heading 2">Social Media: Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter</span></span><span class="EOP SCXW105787335 BCX8" data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559738":40,"335559739":0,"335559740":259}'>&nbsp;</span></span></h2><p>Amy boasted 142k Instagram followers as of January 2021.

Being raised in a haunted house, it was natural for her to see beyond this world. Amy Bruni began her career in a health insurance company. She worked in a variety of positions during her two years there but ultimately left to pursue a passion she has had since childhood.</p><p>Amy began her passion by exploring haunted houses alone. However, she teamed up with Grant Wilson and Jason Haws while joining The Atlantic Paranormal Society to organize it. Amy then joined the Ghost Hunters team and embarked on a journey to locate the spirits. She appeared alongside the team in over a hundred episodes.</p><p>She was also a founding member of the group that founded Beyond Reality Radio. Additionally, she appeared in the films Access Daily (2010), Paranormal Lockdown (2016), and Haunted Salem: Live (2019).</p><p>However, it was her role as host of the television show Kindred Spirits (2016–2020) that elevated her to a wider level of prominence as a ghost hunter. Not only did she host the show, but she also served as an executive producer.</p><p>Amy is also the founder of Strange Escapes, a paranormal travel agency that assists travelers in locating the country’s most haunted locations.</p><p>Along with her television appearances, Amy Bruni wrote and published a book titled Life with the Afterlife: 13 Truths I Discovered About Ghosts.</p><h2><span id=What_is_the_Net_worth_of_Amy_Bruni><span class="TextRun SCXW268285929 BCX8" lang=en-us xml:lang=EN-US data-contrast=none><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW268285929 BCX8">What is the Net worth of Amy Bruni?</span></span><span class="EOP SCXW268285929 BCX8" data-ccp-props='{"201341983":0,"335559739":160,"335559740":259}'>&nbsp;</span></span></h2><p><strong>Amy Bruni earned a total net worth of $800 thousand</strong> as of this writing from her shows, book sales, and radio appearances.</p><p><b><span data-contrast=auto>Amy Bruni&nbsp;estimated Net Worth</span></b><span data-contrast=auto>, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
