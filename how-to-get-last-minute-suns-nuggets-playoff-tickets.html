It will cost you $15 but gets you out pretty quickly after games. Be aware that it’s roughly a ten-minute walk to the arena.</p><p>•&nbsp;The best shirts to wear are black and orange so when the opposing team looks in the stands, they know the arena is filled with Suns fans.</p><p>• That being said, most folks in the crowd are wearing Suns jerseys with players’ names on the back.</p><p>• Suns chants from fans include “Let’s go Suns,” “Beat LA”, “Refs you suck,” “Westbrick” (TBD how fans will heckle Jokić), “Defense” and “Airball.”</p><p>•&nbsp;The best seats are at the half court line in the lower level. Anything in the lower level is good but it’s best not to be behind the basket because you can’t see both ends of the court as well. Same holds true for upper-level seats.</p><p>•&nbsp;At the games I went to, the halftime entertainment was great. They have many famous musicians perform — although being 67 means I’ve never heard any of them. I think they’re deejays. My favorite non-basketball part of the game is when the dunk squad comes out. They fly and tumble in the air and then dunk. Plus, there are also amazing break dancers.</p><p>•&nbsp;Every fan in the lower-level was given a high-quality Suns T-Shirt and were on our seats when we arrived. It’s possible everyone got one.</p><p>When we went to the first game, we walked around the concourse during halftime and my son (Ed. note: the son he’s talking about is the author’s brother) left the shirt on his seat. When we came back, his shirt had been snatched. We learned our lesson. When we went to the second game, my son made sure we took our complimentary shirts with us when we went out for our mid-game stroll.</p><p>•&nbsp;Be ready to stand and cheer when the Suns make their first basket, the game gets close, we need a stop or the team makes an awesome play.</p><p>• Most importantly, prepare to control your emotions when opposing fans root their teams on. No need to get in a fight!</p><p>•&nbsp;Let’s go Suns!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How to watch the Suns-Nuggets series on TV</h2><p>Fans hoping to catch Booker and Durant take on Jokić and Caldwell-Pope on the tube can watch all second-round playoff games on ABC, ESPN, TNT and NBA TV.</p><p>Just make sure to check your local listings before tuning in.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Huge concert tours in 2023</h2><p>Many of the biggest names in music are conducting massive tours all over North America this year.</p><p>Here are just five of our favorite acts you won’t want to miss when they come to a city near you.</p><p>•&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" data-nyp-affiliate=true>Drake</a></p><p>•&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" data-nyp-affiliate=true>George Strait with Chris Stapleton</a></p><p>•&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" data-nyp-affiliate=true>Beyoncé</a></p><p>•&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" data-nyp-affiliate=true>Blink 182</a></p><p>•&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" data-nyp-affiliate=true>Guns N’ Roses</a></p><p>Want to see who else is on tour?
