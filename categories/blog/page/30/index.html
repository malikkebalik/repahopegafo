The Detroit Pistons just put a bow on a campaign that saw 17 wins over a six-month span. That’s three wins per month — if you’re willing to fudge the numbers and be generous.
Some would say that’s unacceptable. Young team. Old team. Rebuilding. Championship contender. Whatever. It doesn’t matter. The average fan doesn’t want to hear the reasons why. Selling hope amid such daily disappointment is harder than selling water to a whale.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Fantasy football Week 1 advice recap: Who to start and sit in Week 1</h2><time>Aug 22, 2024</time>

<a href=../../../../jupiter-baby-name-meaning-origin-and-popularity.html></a>
Jupiter's partner Juno has entered the mainstream, so it's possible that her divine mate could follow. But not necessarily for boys —&nbsp;Jupiter is currently mostly female in the US, thanks to its similarity to Juniper. Stars including Ed Sheeran and Ashley Tisdale recently welcomed daughters named Jupiter, which could shift the balance even more towards the girls. The name of the supreme Roman deity and the largest planet has until recently had either too hippie or too grandiose a feel for most mortals, but with the rise of sound-alike Juniper and space names such as Orion and Mars, Jupiter may find new favor.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Mai Mahiu Floods: Death Toll Rises to 45</h2><time>Aug 22, 2024</time>
