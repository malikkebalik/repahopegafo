But Desiree chose “Dog Love” for specific reasons, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ </a>reports. “One, it’s something X himself used to say. Second, our sources say Desiree considers a dog’s love to be unconditional, much like X’s,” the site noted. It added that she got the tattoo done on the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>day of his death</a>, shortly after X passed away at the age of 50 following complications of a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>massive heart attack</a> he suffered one week prior.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Kristal shared a photo of her work on Desiree’s arm to Instagram and paid tribute to the late <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Yonkers, NY native</a>. “I feel honored to be able to do this memorial but also saddened. Your light was unmatchable. @desi123love I pray you find your way through these dark times, and remember the love you had for each other will forever be untethered. I’m glad I got to witness it,” she began in the caption.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>“The world lost an icon but also a great father. Praying for your family. REST IN POWER DMX. Thanks for inspiring us, and giving Yonkers a voice. You moved the world and left your mark. The city misses you,” Krystal added with the hashtags ” #doglove #dmx #ripdmx #ruffryders.” She also included photos alongside Desiree, and one showing her arm in arm with DMX himself, as well as a snapshot of the trio on a dinner night out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/DMX-Fiancee-Dog-Love-Tattoo-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>Desiree is the mother of DMX’s <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>15th and youngest child</a>, son <strong>Exodus</strong>. X proposed to her on their child’s Aug. 2019 third birthday at a Sky Zone trampoline park in front of their friends and relatives. The pair had been together since 2013. A week after being hospitalized and amid numerous <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>false rumors of his passing</a>, DMX’s family confirmed the sad news that he was gone on Apr. 9.
