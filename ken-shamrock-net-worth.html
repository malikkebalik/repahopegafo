Ken’s net worth primarily comes from his career in wrestling and mixed martial arts.</p><p>Shamrock experienced many struggles in his earlier years, as his father left the family when he was young. They moved to Napa, California when his mother remarried. At the age of ten, Shamrock was stabbed during a robbery, sent to juvenile hall, and at the age of thirteen, sent away from his home. With no place to live, Shamrock spent his days and nights on the streets until he was placed in a Boys’ Home. Shamrock’s misery followed him through high school and, despite doing well in wrestling competitions and even qualifying for state championships, he broke his neck before the main event and had to undergo serious surgery.</p><p>However, this did not hinder Shamrock from pursuing a professional wrestling career. In 1989, Ken Shamrock made his debut in the South Atlantic Pro Wrestling promotion and was later introduced to the Japanese wrestling organization “Fujiwara Gumi” as well as mixed martial arts. His successful beginnings in the Japanese league led to the creation of “The Pancrase” promotion, which he founded with his fellow wrestling friends Masakatsu Funaki and Minoru Suzuki. With the start of “The Pancrase”, Ken Shamrock became a huge celebrity in Japan, attracting large audiences to his matches and increasing his net worth. In 1993, Shamrock made a return to the US and joined the Ultimate Fighting Championship.</p><p>The highlight of his UFC career was his rivalry with Royce Gracie and Dan Severn, whom he defeated to become the UFC Superfight Champion. Shamrock’s performances in the ring earned him the nickname “The World’s Most Dangerous Man”. Despite leaving the UFC in 1997 and joining the World Wrestling Federation, where he secured wins in the WWF Intercontinental Championship, Tag Team Championship, and in 1998, won the King of the Ring event.</p><p>Shamrock made a comeback to the UFC before focusing on individual matches. His fighting career raised criticism and calls for retirement due to his age and the injuries he suffered. Nevertheless, Ken is considered one of the top 10 best mixed martial artists of all time. Currently, he is taking a break from the ring and works as a security guard for 50 Cent.</p><p>In his personal life, Ken was first married to Tina Ramirez, and they have four children but divorced in 1992. He has been married to Tonya since 2005 and is a stepfather to her three children.</p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmiinqZdqLWiudGomqRlnprBbsPOq6uhZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./justin-timberlake.html><span>←</span><span>Justin Timberlake</span></a>
