Yes, you read that right! Since Season 4 was shot on the calm and sunny beaches of Florida, fans expected a similar shoot location for Season 5. In the Season 5 premiere of 'Floribama Shore', the gang will reassemble in Georgia, and fans will get to see Candace Rice rebranding the show as ‚ÄúGeorgibama Shore". Quick with the puns, we like the sound of that, Rice!</p><p>To add to the long list of events, will pull up her middle finger to someone she might have a riff-raff with, would have reached its end stages, making it difficult for her to be the party animal she used to be. Having said that, the show will be retaining its main element (of surprises and , so to say) and paving the way for a lot more hip and happening parties. The group will also have feature cameos of furry friends, including both puppies and pigs. What fun!</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In the recently aired episode of 'Floribama Shore', we see Candace Renee Rice bringing out her true self; an action nobody expected or saw coming. They say "Desperate times call for desperate measures" but we're all on the same page here with Candace; the reaction being "What did we just see?"</p><p>Here's what happened: A piece of meat gets stuck in Candace's teeth. Like any "normal" person would, she asks Nilsa for her hair so that she can use it to remove the food bits, by using the strand as floss. It's safe to say that fans didn't really know what hit them!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/9f1789f4-1f98-47e0-bc9c-1e3d29f2b1a4.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/39715137-d25b-4dc9-829a-129921e2226a.jpg><p>A fan tweeted, "Did Candace just.... use Nilsa's hair.... as floss #MTVFloribamaShore".&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Did Candace just.... use Nilsa's hair.... as floss? üò≥</p>‚Äî MTV Floribama Shore (@FloribamaShore) <a href=#>September 17, 2021</a><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><p>Many fans were grossed out at Candace's actions.
