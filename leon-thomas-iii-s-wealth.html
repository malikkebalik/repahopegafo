From a young age, Leon showcased his acting and musical talents. His career burgeoned when he was cast as Young Simba in the Broadway musical “The Lion King” at just 10 years old. A year later, he featured as Jackie Thibodeaux in the original Broadway cast of “Caroline, Or Change.” Additionally, he played a part in the Broadway production of “The Color Purple” in 2005, all of which laid a solid foundation for his net worth.</p><p>In 2006, Leon made his screen debut as TY in a couple of episodes of the TV series “Just For Kicks” and soon followed this with the role of Arthur in the film “August Rush” (2007). Since then, his career and net worth have been on an upward trajectory, with notable roles in high-profile films and TV series. His portrayal in the TV series “Victorious” (2010-2013) as Andre Harris significantly added to his net worth, as the show aired for three full seasons. Post-“Victorious,” Leon seamlessly transitioned to another engaging role as Mateo in the V series “Satisfaction” (2014).</p><p>His singing career, which took off in recent years, has also contributed to his net worth. In 2012, he released his first mixtape, “Metro Hearts,” featuring a collaboration with pop star Ariana Grande. Subsequently, he wrote a few songs for Ariana`s album “Yours Truly” (2013). Leon released another mixtape in 2014, titled “V1bes,” and collaborated with Wiz Khalifa on the duet “Hello How Are You.” Moreover, his involvement in albums “Victorious: Music from the Hit TV Show” and “Victorious 2.0: More Music from the Hit TV Show” during his time in the TV series further boosted his wealth.</p><p>Personally, Leon Thomas III is currently presumed to be single and is known for his love for playing several instruments, such as the piano and guitar. He is very active on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, where he has a substantial following. Presently, he resides in Los Angeles, California.</p><ul class=tabs-menu><li>Structural Info</li><li>Pictures</li><li>Filmography</li><li>Awards</li></ul><table><tbody><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Leon Thomas III</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$250,000</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>August 1, 1993</td></tr><tr><td>Died</td><td>May 8, 1999, New York City, New York, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Brooklyn, New York City, New York, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5 ft 8 in (1.7526 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Singer, Actor, Songwriter, Record producer</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Tennessee State University</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Jayon Anthony</td></tr><tr><td>Nicknames</td><td>Leon Thomas III , Thomas III, Leon , Leon Thomas , Leon G.
