Amazon Prime Video will broadcast the game.</p><p>The AFC North is as up for grabs as any division in football. Every team is above .500 despite the Bengals and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=55 href=#>Steelers</a> having negative point differentials.</p><p>Let’s begin with the Ravens — they remain atop the division and could hold their spot with a second win this season over Cincinnati. Playing a clean game is presumably planted firmly at the top of their list of priorities, and for good reason. The Ravens have lost the turnover battle in their three defeats this season, highlighted recently by a late <a class=ath_autolink data-id=8vrQt8GE4bS4X4Xa href=#>Lamar Jackson</a> miscue down the stretch of Week 10’s loss to the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=38 href=#>Browns</a>.</p><p>Offensive tackle <a class=ath_autolink data-id=r8lyFiONGOKTD2Tc href=#>Ronnie Stanley</a> will miss the game with a knee injury, and cornerback <a class=ath_autolink data-id=k3hgsWOm37KyaIQG href=#>Marlon Humphrey</a> is questionable with a calf injury. Neither practiced this week.</p><p>Now, onto Cincinnati. Not that a loss this Thursday to the Ravens would spell doom for <a class=ath_autolink data-id=MHPQIoyRCSO0fiiE href=#>Joe Burrow</a> and the Bengals, but it would make their road to a third consecutive AFC North championship an increasingly bumpier one. A loss means Baltimore owns the tiebreaker if that’s needed. A win would keep Cincinnati in the mix, which is incredible given the 1-3 start the Bengals had at the start of the season.</p><p>The Bengals’ offense was healthy and rounding into form before last week’s home loss to Houston. <a href=#>Burrow</a> is averaging 296 yards passing per game in his last five.</p><p>Burrow again will be without wide receiver <a class=ath_autolink data-id=TbtHrFRp7Lrr9gRR href=#>Tee Higgins</a> (hamstring) and defensive end <a class=ath_autolink data-id=9OnaNumWYpHuRN4W href=#>Sam Hubbard</a> (ankle). <a class=ath_autolink data-id=ToHiDqo1AnUHYTWK href=#>Ja’Marr Chase</a> is no longer on the injury report after nursing a sore back last week.</p><p>All&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">odds from BetMGM</a>.
