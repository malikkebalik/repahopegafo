And although she played a hilarious mom on the hit sitcom for many seasons, she is actually also a mother in real life!

We have made the difficult decision to divorce,” the two said in a statement to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Page Six</a>. “As two people that love and care for one another very much, we politely ask for respect of our privacy at this time as we navigate this new phase of our lives.” The ex power couple tied the knot in Nov. 2015 and did not welcomed any children together.</p><h2>Who Is Sofia Vergara’s Son?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Sofia welcomed her son, Manolo, with her first husband, <strong>Joe Gonzalez</strong>, in Sept. 1991. Her 31-year-old son ended up pursuing a career in acting just like his A-lister momma. A few of his projects include&nbsp;White Rabbit, Destined to Ride, and Guilty Party. Not only has Manolo ended up being a successful actor, but he’s also acted alongside Sofia in the hit movie,&nbsp;Hot Pursuit, starring&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Reese Witherspoon</strong></a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Aside from his work as an actor, Manolo is often spotted supporting his mom at work, including her tapings for&nbsp;AGT. “Never a dull moment at @agtauditions @agt,” he captioned a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>behind-the-scenes clip</a> on Apr. 15. Prior to that, he attended the premiere of his step-father’s show,&nbsp;Moon Haven,&nbsp; on June 28, 2022. “Congrats, Joe! The show is awesome! #Moonhaven on AMC+ 7/7/2022!!!!!!!”, he captioned <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the selfie</a> with his mom and Joe.</p><h2>What Sofia Vergara Has Said About Motherhood</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>The 51-year-old doting mom frequently shares throwback photos via Instagram of her and Manolo, in addition to current photos. In Apr. 2020, she shared a sweet <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>throwback photo</a> with her son when he was<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> just a toddler</a>. “#tbt The 90’s Miami,” she captioned the sweet snapshot at the time. Nearly three years later, Sofia shared another<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> flashback photo</a> with her son from the 1990s. “#tbt the 90s,” she captioned the post, along with a red heart emoji.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Since Sofia became a mom when she was 19 years old, she understood that would change her life. During a 2011 interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>RedBook Magazine</a>, the&nbsp;AGT&nbsp;judge revealed what made it harder to be a young mom. “It’s a big responsibility; you can’t go out much at night. Instead of buying a pair of shoes, you have to buy diapers. When you have a kid, you have to be more mature,” Sofia said at the time. Although she listed the cons, she also noted what the pros were. “I do think it was fantastic to have a kid young. My friends now are all panicking if they haven’t found somebody to have kids with. It was never like that for me because I already had the kid!”, she added.</p><h2>Her Frozen Embryo Battle With Her Ex</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Sofia-Vergara-Son-Manolo-SS-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-14>In recent years, Sofia reached a legal victory after her ex boyfriend,&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Nick Loeb</strong></a>, attempted to use frozen embryos they made together without her consent. The duo broke off their engagement in 2014, about one year after they created frozen pre-embryos via IVF. His now-ex filed court documents in California in 2017 to block Nick from using the embryos without her consent, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a>. Ultimately, a Los Angeles court ruled in favor of the&nbsp;Wild Card&nbsp;star to block her ex from using the embryos “without the explicit written permission of the other person,” per the court documents obtained by the outlet in Mar. 2021. In 2020, Nick directed and starred in the movie,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Roe v. Wade</a>, about the real-life supreme court case on <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>abortion laws</a> in the United States.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9KonaKZXauys7PAq5hmq5%2BjenZ9j3BrcXBf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./stefon-diggs-net-worth-details-about-nfl-career-wealth-assets-income.html><span>←</span><span>Stefon Diggs Net Worth: Details About NFL, Career, Wealth, Assets, Income</span></a>
