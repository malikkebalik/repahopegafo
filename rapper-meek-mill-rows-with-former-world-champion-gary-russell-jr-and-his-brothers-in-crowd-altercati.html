Good wins."</p><p>Giving an account of what happened, Showtime president Stephen Espinoza told <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Fight Hub</a>: "We had different fan bases.</p><p>"We had the Russells, we had Meek Mill, we had a little bit of conflict.</p><p>"Everybody walked away with no problems. It was just a lot of yelling and pushing."</p><p>Davis now will likely go on to fight Ryan Garcia next after taking care of Hector Luis Garcia.</p><p>"A little surprised, but when I caught him, I knew he was hurt he was hurt bad," Davis said. "He's a fighter, so he didn't want to show it. I knew he was hurt, though."</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">talkSPORT BET OFFER OF THE DAY</h3></p><p>Get up to £25 in free bets + 25 free spins* - <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>CLAIM HERE</strong></a></p><p>18+ New customers only.
