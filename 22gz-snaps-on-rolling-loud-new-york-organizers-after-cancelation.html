NYPD AINT LET @22gzofficial GO TO ROLLING LOUD but @fivioforeign can? Something ain’t sit right.”</p><p>He later added: “LOOKING FOR NEW MANAGEMENT. YOU CAN’T BE BROKE TRYIN’ TO DO THIS JOB. Rolling Loud police too. Pay attention. They part of the blackball.”</p><p>22Gz was first banned from the annual music festival in 2019 along with&nbsp;Casanova, <a href=# rel=noopener>Pop Smoke,</a> Sheff G and Don Q, with the NYPD claiming there was “a higher risk of violence” if they performed. Law enforcement was apparently concerned about&nbsp;his extensive criminal record.</p><p>In 2017, 22Gz was accused of killing a man during a fight over a parking spot in Miami Beach. Prosecutors later dropped the charges, although he served several months in jail before being released.</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2022/09/220924-playboi-carti-kanye-west-getty.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Kanye West Joins Playboi Carti For Surprise Performance At Rolling Loud NY</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>September 24, 2022</p></a><p>The following year, he was charged with criminal possession of a weapon, criminal possession of marijuana and criminal trespassing after he was found with a taser and large quantity of weed in a Brooklyn basement.</p><p>Then in June, 22Gz was arrested in New York on <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>second-degree attempted murder charges</a> over a March shooting in which three people were injured.
