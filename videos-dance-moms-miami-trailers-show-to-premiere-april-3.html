Nope! Dance Moms: Miami will feature Stars Dance Studio and its two instructors: Victor Smalley and Angel Armas Salabert.</p><p>Check out the preview trailer and see what you think!</p><p></p><p>Here is the 411 on the show from Lifetime:</p><p style=padding-left:30px>Lifetime’s all-new docu-series Dance Moms: Miami will go behind-the-scenes at Miami-based Stars Dance Studio, where the school’s owners and renowned contemporary dance instructors Victor Smalley and Angel Armas teach, train and choreograph a diverse group of talented girl and boy dancers as they strive to become the best in the sport of competitive dance and tomorrow’s stars. Born and raised in Miami, Victor has become well known throughout the dance world for his contemporary choreography, with his first big break as a <a href=#>finalist on season six of the hit show, So You Think You Can Dance</a>. Angel was born in Sagua La Grande, Villa Clara, Cuba. At the age of 12 his interest in dance ignited when he began taking lessons in ballroom dance and now his choreography is in high demand by local TV shows, concerts and artists.</p><p style=padding-left:30px>While Victor and Angel fiercely dedicate their lives to their craft, they expect the same from both their young students and their mothers. What envelops the series’ unique cast, the students’ style of performance and their unwavering pursuit of dance titles are the drama and often conflicting goals and aspirations among teachers, students and parents. All under the watchful eye of Victor’s mother and Stars Dance Studio manager, Mayra Smalley, the team strives to uphold their motto of “Turning Kids into Dancers and Dancers into Stars,” often sparking drama between the competitive mothers.<br><br>Dance Moms: Miami will premiere on Tuesday, April 3, 2012, at 10:30 pm ET/PT — immediately following the 90-minute spring finale of the network’s flagship dance competition docusoap, Dance Moms. Beginning Tuesday, April 10, Dance Moms: Miami will air in its regular time period of 9:00 PM ET/PT.</p><p>Though there is no official cast listing yet from Lifetime, we believe the dancers will be Sammy Small, Jessica Kennedy, Kimberly Kopke, Hannah Epstein, Lucas Triana (yes, Dance Moms: Miami will feature a young boy dancer!), and possibly Mia Diaz.</p><p>And if this next preview clip is any indication, it appears as though Jessica Kennedy’s mom Susan Kennedy is going to be the drama-driving diva this season!</p><p><br><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/starcasm.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Dance_Moms_Miami_tn.jpg alt title="Dance Moms Miami thumbnail" width=1 height=1 sizes="(max-width: 1px) 100vw, 1px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3><span class="share-item twitterbtn"><a href=# class=twitter-share-button data-via=starcasm>Tweet</a></span> <span class="share-item gplusbtn"></span><span class="share-item facebookbtn"></span><span class="share-item pinbtn"><a href=# class=pin-it-button count-layout=horizontal>Pin It</a></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpJa%2FpK3SpmWnnaRkw6qwxKiqZpyRo7CmecyopKxlnZ6urrWMramaoZyav7R50qGmsGWkpHqxvsSmoJ6qlWKusb7IpWRsZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./truck-driver-frank-ingram-towing-killed-in-crash-on-i-575-south-in-cherokee-county.html><span>←</span><span>Truck driver, Frank Ingram Towing killed in crash on I-575 south in Cherokee County</span></a>
