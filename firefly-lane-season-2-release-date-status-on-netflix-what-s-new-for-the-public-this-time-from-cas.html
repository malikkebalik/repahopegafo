This cycle typically repeats numerous times throughout each season. It‚Äôs wonderfully pleasant, then, to see Netflix‚Äôs touching drama Firefly Lane put a benign spin on this genre by focusing on the same turbulent relationship between two best friends spanning more than three decades.</p><p>Katherine Heigl and Sarah Chalke play the adult versions of Tully and Kate, respectively, who have been inseparable since eighth grade when they became neighbors on Firefly Lane. The ten episodes of the first season span the next decades, from the beginning of their friendship in the 1970s through their midlife crises in the early 2000s. It‚Äôs an ode to the strength and tenacity of female friendship, but it‚Äôs also tremendously addicting television; good luck not watching all 10 hours in a single sitting!</p><h2>Firefly Lane Season 2 Status</h2><p>It took a few months, but Netflix finally confirmed that Firefly Lane will return for a second season on May 27th, 2021.</p><p>The revelation was shared on social media and on YouTube, where actors Katherine Heigel and Sarah Chalke answered fan questions and made the formal announcement.</p><p></p><p>Because the first season does not cover the entirety of the novel, there is still more of Tully and Kate‚Äôs journey to be told. Fly Away, a sequel to the novel, expands on the story even more.</p><h2>Firefly Lane Season 2 Release Date Update</h2><p>Katherine Heigl even announced on Instagram that Firefly Lane Season 2 will premiere in 2022. Even though it was good to know the release year for sure, it would have been even better to know the exact release date. But Netflix wouldn‚Äôt have known when season 2 of Firefly Lane would come out.</p><p><strong>In Instagram post-Katherine Heigel Say ‚Äú</strong></p><span class="_aacl _aaco _aacu _aacx _aad7 _aade">Hey you‚Ä¶ yeah I‚Äôm pointing at you! üòâ Hi!!!
