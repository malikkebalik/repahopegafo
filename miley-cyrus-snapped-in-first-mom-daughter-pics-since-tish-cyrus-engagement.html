Miley, 30, and Tish, 55, were photographed leaving the celeb-favorite West Hollywood cafe, Joan's on Third, with takeaway bags in hand, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow>Just Jared</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>They were both dressed casually for the occasion, with matching flared black yoga pants and trainers. Tish was dressed in a gray quarter-zip fleece, while the 'Flowers' singer was dressed in a black tee and a gray cardigan.</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES&nbsp;</strong></p><p><a href=#>Miley Cyrus to have two new stepparents as her mother Tish gets engaged to Dominic Purcell</a></p><p><a href=#>Tish Cyrus reveals the real reason she filed for divorce from Billy Ray Cyrus after 28 years of marriage</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/c9020d90-1f8e-4e29-99b5-6d0a9e77ebaa.1097534216><p>As they strolled across the street with their food, Miley and her mother appeared to be deep in conversation. Miley accessorized her untidy bun with a black headband, and they both wore sunglasses. Of course, Tish was wearing her new engagement ring.</p><h2 class=split>‘A thousand times.... YES’</h2><p>Tish, who was married to country singer Billy Ray Cyrus for nearly 30 years, stated she and her actor beau, Dominic, got engaged in late April after going public with their romance last autumn. "A thousand times.... YES," she captioned a shot of Dominic, 53, throwing his arms around her little waist while she displayed her square-cut engagement ring. Dominic is a British-Australian actor best known for his work in Trinity (2004), Prison Break (2005-2017), and Assault on Wall Street (2013).&nbsp;</p><p>Dominic revealed their engagement by posting an Instagram photo of himself sitting at a table with a friend and joking in the caption that he knows very little about wedding planning.&nbsp; “Men trying to work out a #wedding…….. Ceremony at? —Don’t know? Reception at? —Don’t know? Honeymoon?— Easy, nearest wave,” he wrote before asking for his future wife’s help. “Thoughts Tish? @tishcyrus,” he added.</p><p>Tish was seemingly overwhelmed with the post. She immediately answered in his comment section with a supportive, “I’m on it babe … and def waves!!!!!”</p><h2 class=split>Tish and Billy ‘went into couples therapy’</h2><p>Tish filed for divorce from Billy, 61, in November 2022, citing "irreconcilable differences." They attempted to divorce in 2010 and 2013, but opted to remain together both times.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/6f82baae-bf5b-4582-ba9b-ec2bccb47000.1128781690><p>“We both went into couples therapy, something we haven’t done in 22 years of being together, and it's brought us closer together and really opened up our communication in amazing ways,” read a statement that the 'Achy Breaky Heart' hitmaker's rep gave to <a href=# rel=nofollow>Us Weekly</a> in July 2013. Tish stated that marriage can be extremely difficult, "especially after 22 years in the entertainment industry." The couple said, "We've had our ups and downs, but we both realized we didn't want to be just another statistic and resolved to make it work." But ultimately, their attempts to reconcile failed.</p><p>The former couple shares five children, sons Trace, 33, and Braison, 28, and daughters Brandi, 35, Miley, and Noah, 22. Billy has also moved on after their divorce filing, and is now engaged to Firerose, a 34-year-old Australian singer.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/a3865a12-8ce2-4128-aae3-aee94e09183e.485978262><p>Many fans were troubled by their engagement because the couple met on the set of Hannah Montana, on which Billy co-starred with Miley for years. "And, in some ways, well, in a lot of ways, we became friends," he remembered in November 2022 to <a href=# rel=nofollow>PEOPLE</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRopZmhsrp5wrKprqtdqLuivM%2Bem2ahnmKzqr7SrWSmp51isaLBxqGrnqpdpbakv4ysoKeblWLBqr%2FHZpqyqqWoeqa6xpqenqWVo8E%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./miguel-alvarez-age-bio-height-weight-net-worth-girlfriend.html><span>←</span><span>Miguel Alvarez Age, Bio, Height, Weight, Net Worth, Girlfriend</span></a>
