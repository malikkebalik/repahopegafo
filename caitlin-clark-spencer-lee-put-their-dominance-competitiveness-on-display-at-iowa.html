She was unbelievable.”</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Clark, a junior, scored 42 points against an opponent she never had beaten. It was the second time the all-everything point guard hit the 40-point mark this season. She led the nation in scoring and assists as a sophomore in 2021-22 and ranks second nationally in both categories this season. Her accomplishments, however, often become a footnote to the star power she brings her sport. Clark has become must-see TV, from her logo 3-pointers to her precision passing.</p><p>Mirroring Clark’s prominence in the same facility is 125-pound wrestler Spencer Lee. Competing for one of sports’ greatest dynasties, Lee stands taller than his predecessors despite his 5-foot-3 frame. As one of Iowa’s seven three-time NCAA champions, Lee can become the program’s first four-time winner next month. He would join only four others in NCAA history to hit that mark. But it’s not just that Lee wins; he dominates in a way that few have witnessed.</p><p>“I haven’t seen anybody better. Ever,” said Iowa coach Tom Brands, a three-time NCAA champ as a wrestler, a four-time NCAA championship coach and an Olympic gold medalist in 1996. “I’m talking about my heroes when I was young … and that’s not an overstatement.”</p><p>Big Ten Network’s highest-rated women’s basketball games and wrestling duals have come in the last calendar year featuring Clark and Lee. A second-round NCAA Tournament game involving Clark and her Hawkeyes last March generated nearly 1 million viewers on ABC — and that was opposite the men’s NCAA Tournament. Three Iowa women’s basketball games have soared past 340,000 viewers, and one was up against an <a class=ath_autolink href=#>NFL</a> regular-season game. Iowa wrestling commands BTN’s prime slot, and the network regularly sweats possible overlaps from the previous programming because Lee’s 125-pound match opens most dual meets.</p><p>“There’s a lot of angst right before the match,” said BTN wrestling analyst Jim Gibbons, who won NCAA titles as a wrestler and coach for Iowa State. “Are we going to have enough time? How long is the open going to be? It could be anywhere from three minutes to one minute to go right to live action. We’ve got to really be on our toes.”</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>It’s unusual for two athletes to shape the national narrative about their sport in such an iconic way. To do it as their tenures intersect is rare. But to have it happen at the same Midwestern campus is extraordinary.</p><p>“It’s awesome seeing her do what she’s doing,” Lee said. “We’re both trying to be the best in our sports.”</p><p>“Other than his dominance on the mat, like he is a first-class human being,” Clark said. “I don’t think people realize how incredible he is.”</p><p>Their paths cross only because they represent the same school, but their dominance cannot be understated. Both are favorites to earn national player of the year honors this year. Even more, both are building legacies that have staying power.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Elena drove from New Hampshire to come see Caitlin Clark and <a href=#>@IowaWBB</a> play vs. Penn State. <a href=#>@B1Gwbball</a> with a BIG reach! <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/JwmFxfTKxq</a></p><p>— Meghan McKeown (@MeghanMcKeown_) <a href=#>February 5, 2023</a></p><h2>Transcendent talent</h2><p>Understanding the Clark phenomenon starts at the grassroots level. On a Sunday afternoon in State College, Pa., a young fan held up a sign that read she traveled 450 miles from New Hampshire to watch Clark and hoped for a selfie.</p><p>At Ohio State, girls dressed in Buckeyes apparel stood in line for Clark to sign autographs after the Hawkeyes beat the second-ranked team. And in Iowa City, hundreds of fans crowded the tunnel to slap hands as Clark jogged to the locker room after pregame warmups.</p><p>“There’s kids from the opposing team that have Caitlin Clark posters and ask her for autographs, and they’re wearing <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Ohio State</a> or <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Michigan State</a> things,” Bluder said. “People want to see her play. Last year, we’re playing at Nebraska, and there’s a kid with a sign that says, ‘Caitlin, can I have your shoe laces?’ And she went over and gave them her shoes. I mean, kids cry when they get that sort of stuff. It’s just so good for our game.”</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Iowa’s program averages 10,237 fans per home game, well beyond No. 2 Maryland (6,841) among Big Ten teams. But Clark’s impact is most visible on the road. In Columbus, 9,955 showed up for the Hawkeyes while the Buckeyes averaged 5,344 for their other 11 home games. <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Michigan</a> had 10,731 fans for Clark and company but averaged 3,475 without her. <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Penn State</a> enjoyed 5,228 in attendance with Clark on the floor and averaged 1,911 otherwise.</p><p>“The excitement level when she’s on the floor is different than most players we’ve seen,” ESPN women’s basketball analyst Rebecca Lobo and a Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame inductee said.</p><p>Lee, a Murrysville, Pa., native, generates a similar impact. Every Iowa wrestling dual was sold out this year. In two Big Ten road venues, the Hawkeyes helped set attendance records. As part of a No. 1 versus No. 2 matchup at Penn State, 15,998 fans attended to tie the national indoor record for a dual meet. <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Minnesota</a> averaged 3,216 fans for Big Ten meets but sold out at 5,250 for Iowa. At Wisconsin, a program-record 5,256 fans showed up for a <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Badgers</a>-Hawkeyes dual that doubled as a kids’ day event.</p><p>Afterward, a Wisconsin official asked Lee to sign autographs for 45 minutes. Considering it was a late-afternoon Sunday dual and Iowa had a three-hour bus trip home, the request met some opposition.</p><p>“He’s a celebrity, there’s no doubt,” said Mark Ironside, a two-time national champion, the 1998 Hodge Trophy winner and Iowa wrestling radio analyst. “When you’re on the road, people are like, ‘Hey, are you with the team? Can we get our picture taken with Spencer? Can we meet Spencer?’ He’s the guy that everybody wants to see.”</p><p>There is perpetual resistance to the success of either sport. Wrestling battled to retain Olympic status as recently as 2016. High-profile critics blasted ESPN’s “SportsCenter” for its opening sequence featuring Clark collecting a triple-double at Ohio State.</p><p>But both athletes have more admirers than detractors. Brooklyn Nets forward Kevin Durant called Clark “a killer” on social media. Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes has sent Clark direct messages about wanting to watch her play in person. On Instagram, LeBron James wrote about Clark, “She got so much game!” The <a class=ath_autolink href=#>NBA</a> list goes on with Trae Young and Ja Morant, plus rapper Travis Scott and YouTube sensation Mr. Beast recognizing her skills.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>we got a lot to discuss on this week's ETCS, lock in <a href=#>https://t.co/lPgJqu1Rll</a></p><p>— Kevin Durant (@KDTrey5) <a href=#>February 9, 2022</a></p><p>What’s most important to her is growing awareness of women’s sports, and that begins with young people.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>“All these little girls are sitting in here getting to watch us, or even boys,” said Clark, a Des Moines native. “I take a lot of pride in being a good role model and a big inspiration for them because these are the people I looked up to when I was their age. I thought they were the coolest people in the world, and you can really have a huge impact on their life.”</p><p>Days before the sold-out Iowa-Penn State wrestling dual, Dallas Cowboys and former Penn State linebacker Micah Parsons tweeted his interest in getting tickets. Lee, who participated in several wrestling tournaments with the Pennsylvania native Parsons, told the linebacker he had a seat for him in the Iowa section. Parsons tweeted back, “You my brother but not on war day!”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>The scariest thing about the AP defensive rookie of the year was that he was a better wrestler growing up!! Right <a href=#>@MicahhParsons11</a> <a href=#>https://t.co/vFWeenIx8D</a></p><p>— Spencer Lee (@LeeSpencerlee36) <a href=#>February 24, 2022</a></p><h2>No excuses</h2><p>Three times at Carver-Hawkeye Arena this winter, the crowd level reached 115 decibels. One was on a 3-pointer during a men’s basketball rivalry game. Another was on a Clark 3-pointer against <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Maryland</a>. The third was when Lee pinned third-ranked Liam Cronin of Nebraska in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">38 seconds</a>.</p><p>As he approaches his final matches at Carver-Hawkeye Arena, Lee’s career has taken turns and spills, but every season has ended with him on top. A torn right ACL in high school kept Lee on the sidelines at Iowa until midway through his freshman year in 2018. He won national titles that year and in 2019, during which he re-tore his ACL in the finals. Lee declined surgery, continued to wrestle with a torn ACL in 2020 and ended that campaign as the nation’s most dominant wrestler. He finished 18-0 and won 14 matches either by pin or technical fall. The NCAA Tournament was canceled because of COVID-19, but Lee claimed the Hodge Trophy as the sport’s best wrestler.</p><p>Lee extended his dominance despite a limited schedule the next season. In the 2021 Big Ten tournament, Lee tore his left ACL in the championship match. He fought through the shock and pain and won that match by technical fall. Doctors confirmed the injury, and the coaches left the decision up to Lee and his doctors. Despite being severely limited and struggling to move laterally, Lee won his third national title by outscoring five opponents 59-8. Lee shared a second Hodge Trophy with eventual Olympic gold medalist Gable Steveson.</p><p>After clinching the title, Lee walked to the podium and told the world he had wrestled without a functioning ACL in either knee. He then proclaimed, “Excuses are for wusses.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Spencer Lee: History in the Making | Iowa Wrestling | On The Mat <a href=#>https://t.co/L3Ql0vYaK6</a></p><p>— Mat Talk Online (@mattalkonline) <a href=#>January 27, 2023</a></p><p>“He stepped up, he made the choice and he made the most out of a dire situation,” Brands said. “That’s what the best competitors on this planet do in any circumstance, not just sports.”</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>That tournament gave Lee a new perspective and not just through dealing with pain.</p><p>“It was a learning experience for me, kind of learning how to wrestle in positions that I don’t like getting into when you can’t do the things that you’re used to doing. It was the hard part about it,” Lee said. “But it was also the fun part about it. It definitely showed me you can learn to adapt or change your style anytime in your career.”</p><p>The second ACL tear derailed Lee’s plans to compete in the 2021 Summer Olympics. He first opted for rest, then chose double ACL surgery nine months after winning his third title. He took a medical redshirt for the 2021-22 season and vowed to return stronger than ever. Since returning in December, Lee is 12-0 and has scored bonus team points in every match except for one. He pinned six straight opponents, including four who were ranked in the top 10.</p><p>“His ability to dominate and finish and the fact that he’s becoming more and more explosive as he recovers from these two knee surgeries is really amazing to watch,” Gibbons said.</p><h2>‘Once-in-a-lifetime player’</h2><p>In the moments that followed a 96-82 loss to Iowa, Maryland coach Brenda Frese appeared resigned to the outcome as a singular experience as Clark scored 42 points while adding eight assists and seven rebounds.</p><p>“She’s a once-in-a-lifetime type of player,” said Frese, who coached Maryland’s women’s basketball team to the 2006 NCAA championship and six times has won conference coach of the year honors. “A pleasure to watch play unless you’re scouting her and going against her.”</p><p>Clark’s otherworldly statistics often dull the senses because they become so commonplace. With her ninth career triple-double — the most ever by a Big Ten men’s or women’s basketball player — Clark sits tied for second in NCAA women’s basketball history. With 28 points, 10 rebounds and 15 assists at Ohio State, Clark joined Dwyane Wade as the only college basketball players since 2000 with a triple-double against a top-two opponent. Only Clark and Elena Delle Donne have reached 2,000 points by their 75th career game.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Caitlin Clark is ridiculous. Logo shot and another monster game.</p><p>46 PTS<br>10 AST<br>4 REB<br>3 STL</p><p>(via <a href=#>@IowaWBB</a>)<a href=#>pic.twitter.com/mkMj4wTjRn</a></p><p>— Bleacher Report (@BleacherReport) <a href=#>February 7, 2022</a></p><p>“It’s just everything that you see,” Lobo said. “Her ability to score — not only from her deep range — but getting to the basket. She is phenomenal involving teammates. She’s a terrific passer, an exciting passer. She brings a little bit of extra swag with her, too; that’s really fun to watch.”</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Known for 35-foot-plus 3-point attempts often from the center court logo, Clark regularly shrugs, puckers her lips and cups her palms after they swish. She also draws negative attention from officials.</p><p>At Northern Iowa in 2021, Clark hit a 3-pointer, turned near midcourt and said something toward her bench. She received a technical foul for taunting. After the opponent free throws, Clark stole the ball on the ensuing possession, drilled another 3-pointer and shrugged.</p><p>In mid-January, Clark missed a free throw against <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Northwestern</a> and shouted, “Damn it.” She was whistled for a technical foul. Midwestern apparel company RayGun capitalized on the moment and printed “Damn It” shirts, many of which are worn frequently in Iowa City.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Tried to find the perfect outfit for the <a href=#>@IowaWBB</a> game to support the awesome <a href=#>@CaitlinClark22</a> . How’d I do <a href=#>@RAYGUNshirts</a> ? <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/jHAvsuU5Nr</a></p><p>— Cathy Zaharis (@cathyz1) <a href=#>January 14, 2023</a></p><p>“I think there is (a double standard),” Clark said. “We’re still kind of developing in that regard. I think people are more and more starting to realize women should play with emotion. They should play with passion. They should play with that excitement. That’s what the game should be, and that’s what makes it so exciting.</p><p>“Maybe at times, I can turn it down. Absolutely. I’m not disagreeing with that. But it is what makes me who I am, and a lot of other girls play with that, as well. That’s how it is. That’s how the game should be played. If males can play the game like that, females definitely should be allowed to, too.”</p><p>When she’s on the floor, the excitement level increases, and Clark matches the atmosphere with flair. For a Saturday afternoon game against <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Nebraska</a> that appeared on Fox, Clark donned Nike 6 Kobe Green Grinch shoes. She finished with 33 points, nine assists and eight rebounds.</p><p>“She plays with a passion and a joy that people really enjoy watching,” Bluder said. “That’s why that technical really bothered me when she got that because that was so unnecessary. We don’t want a bunch of robots out there. That’s no fun to watch.”</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><h2>‘They’re paying attention’</h2><p>To greet Lee and Clark is to embrace the soul of competitiveness. Lee has a megawatt smile and enjoys Pokemon, which inspired his walk-up song at the 2018 and 2019 NCAA championships. He’s also introverted, eccentric and prefers fantasy books as opposed to hunting like many of his teammates. He calls himself a “lone wolf.”</p><p>Clark carries herself like an NFL quarterback with polish and poise. She unwinds away from the court with Fortnite, Netflix and baking. She grew up in a large Italian family as the only girl in her age group with five boys slightly older and five others slightly younger.</p><p>“It’s a special gift that I think just she’s had ever since she’s been born,” Clark’s roommate and teammate Kylie Feuerbach said. “She’s just a natural leader. She’s literally just a normal roommate. We make sure our apartment is always clean. We organize our shoes; she bought a shoe rack, like during the summer, because she’s been getting a lot of shoes lately.”</p><p>Both Clark and Lee have name, image and likeness deals with industry-leading apparel companies. Clark signed with Nike, and her branding opportunities appear limitless in part because of her “Iowa-Midwest girl wholesomeness that people are looking for,” according to Bluder.</p><p>Lee has a deal with fledgling wrestling outlet Rudis, but he’s limited in how he promotes the company. Iowa is a Nike school so he cannot wear Rudis inside Carver-Hawkeye Arena. Plus, his contract states he won’t have a shoe deal until he wins an Olympic gold medal.</p><p>Lee’s entire focus is centered on the mat, and he turns down almost every proposal from his agent, Kyle Strongin.</p><p>“The market value of myself will never be any higher than it is now, in college,” Lee said, “even if I do win the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Olympics</a> and world championships multiple times. To me, it’s not about making money; it’s about winning wrestling matches. So, unless it makes sense in the grand scheme of things, I just say no.”</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Several agents made pitches to Clark, but she opted for her family’s guidance. Along with her Nike deal, Clark appears in commercials for regional grocery chain Hy-Vee, along with Mahomes and <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Kansas City</a> Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce.</p><p>“I’m lucky to have really good people around me,” Clark said. “I think it really has even bolstered my image and put me on an even bigger stage in a good way, of course. I think that goes for women’s basketball.”</p><p>As their seasons hit a critical stretch, Clark and Lee are focused on the ultimate prize. For Clark, that’s a Final Four appearance. For Lee, it’s a fourth NCAA title. Then it’s Olympic training for Lee, while Clark has another year of school before attempting to make the Olympic team and embarking on a <a class=ath_autolink href=#>WNBA</a> career. No matter how the season turns out, people will tune in to watch the two most recognizable faces in their sports.</p><p>“Even if there’s haters, they’re paying attention,” Brands said. “Along the way you convert a lot of people to your side because you can’t help but love a winner.”</p><p>(Illustration: Eamonn Dalton / The Athletic; Photos: G Fiume, Hunter Martin / Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57k2ptbWxkaHxzfJFsZmlqX2WGcLXOsJhmr5%2Bisq%2B%2FjJuYrKOVqa%2BiuMtmrqudo6m5qrrGZpqaoaShtq95wqWYq6NdqL2musKeqWaklZp8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./beastie-boys-brass-monkey-is-actually-a-pre-mixed-cocktail.html><span>←</span><span>Beastie Boys Brass Monkey is actually a pre-mixed cocktail</span></a>
