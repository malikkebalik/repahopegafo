I thought, ‘that’s her way.’</p><p>– I ran from one side of the city as fast as I could, but I couldn’t get up because the guards blocked everything.</p><p>He added: “There was something in me that didn’t want to believe it was their car, but I could see the car, and then I knew what it was. It was hard.”</p><p>Aaron and Grace met at a party thrown by Zoey, who also died in the accident.</p><p>Aaron said: “The first day I met Grace was probably one of the happiest days of my life. We just clicked. She was the love of my life.”</p><p>He described the close relationship between Grace and her friends, saying the girls “were just wild fun together”, adding: “You couldn’t keep them apart.”</p><p>Aaron’s emotional tribute comes as a memorial vigil is to be held for the four youngsters this evening.</p><p>Hundreds of people are expected to gather at 6.30pm at Denis Burke Park in Clonmel.</p><p>Yesterday evening, the girls’ principals recognized their talented students.</p><p>Zoey and Grace attended Presentation High School in Clonmel, while Nicole attended the neighboring school, Loreto.</p><h2>‘SADNESS AND DEsolation’</h2><p>The astonished professors said that all three girls got excellent results in their exams and can’t wait to start the next phase of their lives.</p><p>Michael O’Loughlin, headteacher of Presentation High School, said: “Today our school and our city are covered in a cloud of sadness and devastation.</p><p>“This morning we mourn the loss of our high school seniors Zoey Coffey and Grace McSweeney, who lost their lives in yesterday’s tragic accident.</p><p>“We also remember Grace’s brother, Luke McSweeney and Nicole Murphy, a pupil at our neighboring school, Loreto.</p><p>“Zoey and Grace received their Leaving Certificate results yesterday and are about to embark on a new chapter in their lives.</p><p>“A day of celebration has now been replaced by unbearable sadness and a sense of great loss for our local community.

There are no words to express our sadness, pain and grief.”</p><h2>‘BEAUTIFUL STUDENTS’</h2><p>Mr O’Loughlin continued: “Zoey and Grace were two wonderful students, loved by all who met them and achieved such excellent results on Friday.”</p><p>Headteacher Anne McGrath, from Loreto Clonmel, described Nicole as a “highly valued” pupil and a “faithful friend”.</p><p>She said: “There are no words to express our grief, pain and sorrow.
