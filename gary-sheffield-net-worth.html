He played for eight MLB teams, including the San Diego Padres, Los Angeles Dodgers, and New York Mets. His professional playing career was active from 1988 to 2009. Currently, he is known as a sports agent.</p><p>So, have you ever wondered how rich Gary Sheffield is, as of mid- 2016? Sources estimate that Gary counts his net worth at the impressive amount of $90 million, with the main source of this sum of money being his career as a professional baseball player. Additional to this, when he retired he started working as a sports agent, which has also added to his net worth.</p><h3>Gary Sheffield Net Worth $90 Million</h3><p>Gary Sheffield was raised in Belmont Heights by a single mother, and they lived with his uncle, Dwight Gooden, who was only four years older than him. They together began to play baseball, and at the age of 11, he became a member of Belmont Heights Little League team, which reached the Little League World Series final in 1980, where they were defeated by Taiwan. However, Gary distinguished himself as a baseball player once again while attending Hillsborough High School, playing in the position of third baseman and pitcher. As a senior, he was named the Gatorade National Player of the Year, after hitting .500 with 15 home runs.</p><p>Upon matriculation, he entered the 1986 MLB draft and was selected by the Milwaukee Brewers as the sixth overall pick; he was sent to play in the Pioneer League, and in 1987 Gary signed a contract with the Stockton Ports of the Class-A California League. He led the league in RBIs with 103, and he was named the Brewers’ best prospect, after which he was ready to begin playing in the Major League.</p><p>His net worth began to increase steadily from the contracts he signed with the Milwaukee Brewers, as he stayed in the team until 1991. He made his major league debut on the 3rdSeptember 1988, playing in the position of shortstop, and in his first season Gary finished with four home runs and batted .238 average in 24 games, after which he was sent down to the minor league again. When he returned back, because of a fractured bone in his right foot he began by playing in the position of third base. In his last season with the Brewers, Gary made a total of 10 home runs and batted .294 average. As he was a problematic player – accusing the club of racism – his coach decided to trade him in 1992 to the San Diego Padres, where he stayed only one year.</p><p>In 1993, he was traded to the Florida Marlins, and after the first season, the club offered him a four-year deal, after which he became a very successful player, hitting 112 home runs from 1994 to 1998. In 1996 he hit 42 home runs, leading the team to the 1997 World Series where they defeated the Cleveland Indians. His net worth increased by a large margin, but as the team couldn’t afford a contract extension, Gary was sent to the Los Angeles Dodgers, where he stayed from 1998 to 2001, continued with success and making three All-Star games.</p><p>In 2001, he was traded to the Atlanta Braves, spending two seasons with the team, and then he became a free agent. His next stop was the New York Yankees, signing a contract worth $39 million over three years. But he suffered an injury, and in 2007 was traded to the Detroit Tigers, but he finished the 2008 season with an accumulated total of 499 home runs, increasing further his net worth. He played the next season for the New York Mets, and in the game against the Milwaukee Brewers hit his 500th home run, becoming the 25th baseball player in the MLB to reach that mark. Afterwards, as the club did not offer him a contract extension, he decided to retire. However, he stayed in baseball working as a sports agent, contributing a lot to his net worth.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Gary Sheffield is the father of seven children from various relationships, but has been married to DeLeon Richards since 2000, and the couple resides in Tampa, Florida.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=9.1728624535316><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Gary Sheffield</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$90 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>November 18, 1968</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Tampa, Florida, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.8 m</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>86 kg</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Sports agent</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Hillsborough High School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Spouse</td><td>Deleon Richards (m. 2000)</td></tr><tr readability=9><td>Children</td><td>Noah Sheffield, Gary Sheffield Jr., Garret Sheffield,Christian Sheffield, Jaden Sheffield, Carissa Sheffield, Ebony Sheffield</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Betty Jones</td></tr><tr readability=0.35><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/garysheffield</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1246566/</a></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Awards</td><td>Best Breakthrough Athlete ESPY Award</td></tr><tr><td>Movies</td><td>Home Run Showdown</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=31.039425587467><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>1</td><td>(1 April) Released by the Detroit Tigers.
