More than the posts he shares on social media about his late brother, he is also more associated with the media industry due to his own work.</p><p class=Fg>Cody once <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/9645815/brother-tragic-fast-and-furious-star-paul-walker-misses-him-everyday-legacy/>remembered</a> his late older brother as a "goofball," claiming he preferred surfing to acting most of the time. He never imagined reaching international stardom, but he did thanks to the "Fast and Furious" franchise.</p><p class=Fg>Cody also noted how his brother didn't idolize actors like most people, but rather, idolized professional athletes and marine biologists, as that's what he wanted to do in life.</p><p class=Fg>Regardless, he pursued a career in the acting industry, lending his talent to "The Young and the Restless," "She's All That," and many more before finally getting his breakthrough role in "The Fast and Furious" in 2001.</p><p class=Fg>Cody <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/9645815/brother-tragic-fast-and-furious-star-paul-walker-misses-him-everyday-legacy/>noted</a> that his brother would have been "blown away" that the franchise remains successful after all these years. He credited Walker for inspiring his love for cars and travel, adding that he "misses him every day".</p><p class=Fg>The youngest Walker brother has nothing but love, admiration, and respect for his brother that even while he was grieving, he accepted the difficult task of being his body double on "Furious 7" to finish his scenes.</p><p class=Fg>It was both painful and uncomfortable stepping into his older brother's shoes while he was still grieving. Speaking about the experience, he said:</p><p class=Fg>“It was extremely tough. It was a very, very odd - at times uncomfortable situation to be in - because you're pretending to be somebody that was pretending to be someone else."</p><p class=Fg>Despite feeling this way, Cody was glad to have had that experience with his brother Caleb. He claimed it was a healing moment for them, and they were able to strengthen their bond as brothers while working on "Furious 7" together.</p><p class=Fg>Through it all, Cody admitted that he wouldn't have been able to do the film without his brother Caleb. They leaned on one another for support, adding that everybody else on the set was supportive of their family.</p><p class=Fg>Cody confirmed how the "Fast and Furious" cast treated one another like family, extending that love to the rest of the Walkers. They were all very welcoming of the late actor, who did his job well, but ultimately chose to lead a private life when the cameras weren't rolling.</p><p class=Fg>In fact, Cody believes his brother never knew the type of impact he had on other people. The Walkers often meet people on the street who talk about their late brother being the reason they're into cars or their inspiration for other things.</p><p class=Fg>"He did his films, did the publicity, everything that was required of him, and then he would disappear again and go surf or whatever," Cody <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/9645815/brother-tragic-fast-and-furious-star-paul-walker-misses-him-everyday-legacy/>said</a>. Walker believed he was just an average guy, and Cody believes he would have been surprised to know the lasting impact he had on people.</p><p class=Fg>When he wasn't at work or enjoying his passions, Walker was with his daughter, Meadow. The late actor shared her with Rebecca Soteros, his ex-girlfriend, who raised Meadow in Hawaii for a part of her life.</p><h3 class=Kg><strong class=Dg>Despite being so young when her dad passed away, Meadow admits she gets signs from him, especially during times she feels alone.</strong></h3><p><h2 class=Jg><strong class=Dg>Continuing Paul Walker's Legacy</strong></h2></p><p class=Fg>Cody has worked hard to keep his brother's name alive. In 2019, he collaborated with Tyrese Gibson on <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/9645815/brother-tragic-fast-and-furious-star-paul-walker-misses-him-everyday-legacy/>"FuelFest,</a>" a car event inspired by the "Fast and Furious" franchise, which they took to the United Kingdom.</p><p class=Fg>It's a yearly automotive event, pegged by some as the biggest car show in the world. More than Cody and Gibson, they sometimes get surprise visits from good friends, one of whom has been Vin Diesel.</p><p class=Fg>More than FuelFest, Cody has also been able to carry on his late brother's legacy of helping other people through his show, "Fast: Home Rescue." He has moved on from acting in films to hosting the home renovation show, which is directly connected to the late actor's nonprofit.</p><p class=Fg>The show features the resilient stories of families affected by tornadoes, fires, and floods and how Walker's team helped them rebuild their homes and start anew. The series began in 2022 and only has one season to date.</p><p class=Fg>Other than his brothers, Walker left behind a daughter, <a class="Xd a" href=#>Meadow Walker</a>. Despite being so young when her dad passed away, Meadow admits she gets signs from him, especially during times she feels alone.</p><p class=Fg>Meadow considers the numbers "4" and "7" to be signs that her dad was around her, and whenever she feels down, she sees these numbers. She also turns to his movies whenever she misses him, claiming that when she hears his voice, she feels close to him.</p><p class=Fg>Since his passing, his co-stars and brothers have also stepped in to care for Meadow and to make sure she had all the love and support she needs to thrive in life. Her dad's good friend, Vin Diesel, has taken her in like his own, and his three children treat Meadow like their sibling as well.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jm1nb2libnqxrdSlZLCZnKCys7%2BMpaaoo5GhtqyxjJupqKyYmr9uusCmnKxlo6S7b7TTpqM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./leah-felder-filed-for-divorce-from-her-husband-requested-any-spousal-support.html><span>←</span><span>Leah Felder Filed For Divorce From Her Husband: Requested Any Spousal Support?</span></a>
