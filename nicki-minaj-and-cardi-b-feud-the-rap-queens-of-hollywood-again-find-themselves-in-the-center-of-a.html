She had no idea that Nicki Minaj had just shown off a similar look.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/peepswiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Nicki-Minaj-and-Cardi-B-1024x576.jpg><p>The fans didn’t take long to launch a social media comparison between the two rappers’ attire. “You mo–king fans and bi*** are arguing over a coat that I had on for 45 seconds… from my house to my car,” the Bongos singer wrote on her Instagram story on Saturday.</p><p>She went on to say that the only reason she wore that “old a**” coat was because it was made by her aunt and is part of her archival collection.</p><p>“I don’t care about these individuals the way you all seem to care about me,” she asserted, probably referring to Nicki Minaj.</p><p>The rant didn’t end there; the 31-year-old rapper continued, stating that she doesn’t pay attention to these individuals. “They can’t dress compared to me.” She further expressed, “Damn, Fu**** can’t enjoy her life.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>How did Nicki Minaj react to the exaggerated theatrics of her fans?</strong></h2><p>In response to <a href=# data-type=post data-id=13401>Cardi B’s criticism</a> of winter fashion, Nicki Minaj, the Barbie World vocalist, posted a photo of herself wearing an identical fur coat on Instagram, tagging the picture with a lyric from her song.</p><p>As the caption for the photo, she wrote, “B!***es Jackin,” using the lyrics to her song “Barbie Dangerous” from “Pink Friday 2.” “I still Queenin.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Cardi B and Nicki Minaj’s feud</strong></h2><p>Since Cardi B’s career began in 2017, there has been a persistent feud between her and Nicki Minaj.</p><p>For nearly five years, the two singers have been pursuing each other. When Nicki Minaj criticized <a href=# data-type=post data-id=11538>Cardi B’s husband</a>, Offset, in May 2017, a spark was ignited.</p><p>All of this culminated in their legendary altercation at a fashion show. When Nicki’s husband was sent under house arrest in 2023 due to threats against Offset, the story took a dark turn.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolZq9tMPIs2Wcp51kuaLAxKyrZqCfqXyvtcKkoGalmaOuq3nAp5tmm5Gnsap5wWadnq2UZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./clive-owen.html><span>←</span><span>Clive Owen</span></a>
