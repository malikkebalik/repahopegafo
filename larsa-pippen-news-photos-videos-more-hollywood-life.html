As one of Chicago’s favorite daughters, Larsa Pippen would go on to find fame not in the Windy City, but down in South Beach. As a member in the first season of the short-lived Real Housewives of Miami, Larsa got her first taste of fame. Yet, it seemed she didn’t dig the Miami weather, so she packed up her bags to move out west towards Calabasas.</p><h2><strong>Career:</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-2>Born and raised in Chicago, Larsa – who is of Syrian-Lebanese descent – would attend the University of Illinois and graduate with a degree in Political science. She reportedly studied theater at the Piven Theatre Workshop under the tutelage of acclaimed stage director <strong>Byrne Piven</strong>. After graduation, she reportedly worked as a freelance writer, covering fashion, beauty, and fitness. While she wasn’t on the sports beat, she would become involved with one of the biggest ballers in NBA history, <a href=#><strong>Scottie Pippen</strong></a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>In 2011, Bravo unveiled the latest in the Real Housewives franchise, The Real Housewives of Miami. Larsa was included as a cast member of the first season, alongside others like <strong>Cristy Rice, Lea Black</strong>, and <strong>Marysol Patton</strong>. However, Larsa left after the inaugural season, and RHOM was canceled in 2016, marking it to be the second Housewives franchise (after The Real Housewives of D.C.) to get the axe. It was around that time that Larsa befriended <a href=#><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a>, which resulted in a few cameos on Keeping Up with the Kardashians, and its spin-off, Kim and Kourtney Take Miami.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Larsa appeared on two episodes of Selling Sunset in 2020. She shares health, fitness, fashion and beauty tips on her Life with Larsa blog. She’s an ambassador for Haute Living magazine and has worked with Extra as a red carpet correspondent. She also oversees the Pippen Foundation, which does fundraising for various children’s charities.</p><h2><strong>Personal Life:</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>Larsa met Scottie Pippen in 1995, just as the Chicago Bulls were about to secure their second three-peat as NBA Champions. While little is known how and where the two met, clearly, their love was meant to be. They tied the knot on July 20, 1997, at the First United Methodist Temple in Chicago. This would be Scottie’s second marriage. He was previously married to Karen McCollum from 1988 to 1990 (and the marriage produced a son, <strong>Antron</strong>.) Three years after tying the knot, Scottie and Larsa welcomed their first child, <strong>Scotty Jr. </strong>They would welcome three more – <strong>Preston, Justin, </strong>and <strong>Sophia </strong>– over the following eight years.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Unfortunately, Larsa and Scottie’s marriage hasn’t been a perfect mix of love and basketball. The pair filed for divorce in 2016, with rumors that her close relationship with rapper <strong>Future </strong>was to blame. In Oct. 2016, police visited their Ft. Lauderdale home twice after Larsa called 911. During one of the calls, she reportedly said that Scottie got “aggressive,” which he denied. However, by early 2017, the two had reconciled and were back together.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>The romance lasted for another year. In November 2018, <a href=#>Larsa filed for divorce</a> and announced that “we have both tried very hard for a long time to make our marriage work and have ultimately come to the conclusion that it is best that we live separate lives.” As of Sept. 2020, the couple has yet to finalize their divorce and remain legally married.</p><h2><strong>Notable Life Moments:</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>Larsa has a place in Kardashian lore by being the <a href=#>first person to break the news</a> to the family that <a href=#><strong>Tristan Thompson </strong></a>supposedly hooked up with <a href=#><strong>Kylie Jenner</strong></a>’s now-ex-BFF <a href=#><strong>Jordyn Woods </strong></a>at a party. She first told Kim, before sharing the news of this infidelity with <a href=#><strong>Kourtney Kardashian </strong></a>and Tristan’s baby mama, <strong><a href=#>Khloe Kardashian</a>.</strong></p><h2>The Most Popular Questions About Larsa Pippen</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9><strong>Is Larsa Pippen Still Friends with the Kardashians?</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-10>As of 2020, no. During the summer of that year, the Kardashian sisters — Kim, Khloe, and Kourtney — <a href=#>mysteriously stopped following</a> their longtime friend on Instagram, and vice versa. After the social media uncoupling, which followed a <a href=#>tweetstorm</a> by Kim’s husband, <strong>Kanye West</strong>, Lara addressed the incident on Twitter, saying, “I Woke up this morning blessed and see that everybody is focused on who I am following and who I am not following on social media.I am focused on my children, my new fitness brand Larsapippenfitness, and my relationships in real life.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-11><strong>Is Larsa Pippen Still married to Scottie Pippen?</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-12>Technically, yes. Over the years, their relationship has had many ups and downs. Though she filed for divorce in 2018, as of September 2020, the two are still married, despite a reignited feud over their marriage earlier in the year. <span class=s1>Larsa set the record straight about their relationship after several <a href=#>fans defended</a> Scottie’s extramarital activities on Instagram and called her out for allegedly cheating on him.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGianqSVl3ytrdGsmGaomaW9prqO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fedor-emelianenko-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Fedor Emelianenko Net Worth</span></a>
