Who is Karan Johars male partner?</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Karan Johar</a>, who was born Rahul Kumar Johar on May 25, 1972,&nbsp;and is often called KJo in the Hindi Film Industry, is an Indian filmmaker and TV personality who mostly works in Hindi films. He has helped many actors become famous through his own company, Dharma Productions. He has won several awards, including a National Film Award and six Filmfare Awards. In 2020, the Government of India will give him Padma Shri, the country’s fourth highest civilian award.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Karan Johar: Early And Personal Life Details</h2><p>Johar was born on May 25, 1972, in Bombay, India, which is now called Mumbai. His parents, film producer Yash Johar and Hiroo Johar started Dharma Productions. From his father’s side, he comes from Punjabi Hindus, and from his mother’s side, he comes from Sindhi Hindus.&nbsp;He went to Greenlawn’s High School to learn. After Greenlawns, he went to Bombay’s H.R. College of Commerce and Economics (now Mumbai).</p><p>Johar’s first job in the entertainment business was as an actor. He played Shrikant in the Doordarshan TV series Indradhanush in 1989. As a child, commercial Indian movies like those of Raj Kapoor, Yash Chopra, and Sooraj R. Barjatya were important to him.&nbsp;</p><p>Johar used numerology for a while, coming up with movie titles where the first word and a few others began with the letter K. After seeing Lage Raho Munna Bhai, a movie from 2006 that made fun of numerology, Johar decided to stop doing it.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by Karan Johar (@karanjohar)</a></p></figure><p>Johar said this about his sexual orientation: “My sexual orientation is known to everyone. I don’t have to yell it. If I have to say it again, I won’t “.&nbsp;Through surrogacy, Johar became the father of twins (a boy and a girl) in February 2017.&nbsp;</p><p>The twins were born in Mumbai at Masrani Hospital. Johar named his son Yash after his father, and he named his daughter Roohi by changing the order of the letters in his mother’s name, Hiroo.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Karan Johar: “He Just Broke Up With His Girlfriend”</h2><p>Karan Johar, a director, shocked everyone when he said on a new episode of “<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Koffee with Karan 7</a>” that he and his girlfriend had just broken up.</p><p>In the most recent episode, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Varun Dhawan</a> and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Anil Kapoor</a> sat on the famous Koffee sofa.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/image-51-1024x576.png><p>Karan talked to the actors of “Jug Jugg Jeeyo” about s**, cheating, and other things. Still, the best part of the episode was when Varun questioned Karan. Karan talked about cheating in marriages, and Varun couldn’t help but make fun of him. He asked Karan why he was so interested in it. “I’m interested in how people act in general,” KJo replied. Have you been unfaithful to your partner? Varun kept poking at her. Are you not being true?</p><p>“Am I cheating?” asked the host. I have to be with someone to cheat. Varun asked, “So you’re not saying you’re not in a relationship, are you?” Karan replied, “You know I’m not, and you know I broke up.”</p><p>“That’s what I was hoping to hear,” Varun said. Karan even talked about Varun’s help in that relationship. Karan said, “I’m not cheating because I have nothing to cheat with.”</p><p>Karan has always been very private about his romantic relationships and friends. The names of his past partners have never been made known to the public. On the other hand, Varun has been happily married to Natasha Dalal since they were in high school together.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Is Karan Johar Dating Manish Malhotra in 2022?</strong></h2><p>Many people think that Karan Johar, who is a producer, director, and actor, is dating <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Manish Malhotra</a>, who is a fashion designer.
