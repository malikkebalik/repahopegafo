All of his efforts have helped put his net worth to where it is today.</p><p>How rich is Artis Gilmore? As of early-2017, sources estimate a net worth that is at $5 million, mostly earned through a successful career in professional basketball. He was a five time All-Star in the ABA, having been the first pick of the 1976 NBA dispersal draft. All of his achievements helped ensure the position of his wealth.</p><h3>Artis Gilmore Net Worth $5 million</h3><p>Artis attended Carver High School and would matriculate in 1967. Afterwards, he attended Gardner-Webb Junior College and Jacksonville University, playing college basketball for both. He helped the Jacksonville Dolphins get to the NCAA championship game in 1970 but lost against UCLA. He became one of the five college basketball players in Jacksonville to average 20 points and 20 rebounds over his career. He then joined the 1971 ABA draft and was selected by the Kentucky Colonels. He was also selected by the Chicago Bulls in the 1971 NBA draft.</p><p>He opted to join the Kentucky Colonels, and was given a record high contract which immediately increased his net worth. Even at the start of his professional career, he showed his dominance and became the Rookie of the Year as well as the Most Valuable Player of the season, a rare distinction. During his five years, he led the league in rebounds and would also lead two seasons in field goal percentage as well as blocks. He was part of the All-ABA First team for the five seasons, and played in the ABA All-Star game five times. He became the 1974 MVP and helped the Colonels to the 1975 ABA championship, earning him the ABA Playoffs Most Valuable Player award too.</p><p>When the ABA ended in 1976, the league merged with the NBA along with four other teams – the Spurs, Nets, Pacers, and Nuggets. The remaining teams folded, and Gilmore went into the dispersal draft, being selected as the first overall pick by the Bulls. He still performed solidly for Chicago and would earn four All-Star selections before being traded to the San Antonio Spurs. He would then get two more All-Star distinctions through 1987, before returning to the Bulls in 1988, before completing his career with the Boston Celtics. At the time of his retirement he was the NBA leader in field goal percentage with 59.9% during his career. He also played a season with the Italian league team Arimo Bologna, in which he made the European All-Star team.</p><p>After retirement, Artis returned to Jacksonville, becoming the Special Assistant to the President at his alma mater in 2007. He also provided color commentary at the school’s flagship station WJXL. In 2011, he was elected into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, and the following year, he was inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame.</p><p>For his personal life, it is known that Gilmore married his college sweetheart Enola Gay in 1972. They have five children.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=2.2282608695652><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Artis Gilmore</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>September 21, 1949</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Chipley, Florida, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>7' 2" (2.18 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>108.86</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Basketball player</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>Gardner–Webb University, Jacksonville University</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Enola Gay</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Artis Gilmore II</td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2244235/</a></td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=10><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>1</td><td>Inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2011.</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>2</td><td>Played for American Basketball Association's (ABA) Kentucky Colonels (1971-1976), National Basketball Association's (NBA) Chicago Bulls (1976-1982, 1987-1988), San Antonio Spurs (1982-1987) and Boston Celtics (1988).</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>3</td><td>Former professional basketball player.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>4</td><td>Played college basketball at Jacksonville University in Jacksonville, Fla.</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>5</td><td>Played for the ABA's Kentucky Colonels, the NBA's Chicago Bulls, San Antonio Spurs, and Boston Celtics.</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Actor <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=actor><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>The White Shadow</td><td>1979</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Announcer</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Thanks <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=thanks><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>Semi-Pro</td><td>2008</td><td>special thanks</td><td></td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Self <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=self><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>The Nothing But Net Show</td><td>2013</td><td>TV Movie</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>The UCLA Dynasty</td><td>2007</td><td>TV Movie documentary</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>1986 NBA All-Star Game</td><td>1986</td><td>TV Special</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>1983 NBA All-Star Game</td><td>1983</td><td>TV Special</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>1982 NBA All-Star Game</td><td>1982</td><td>TV Special</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>1981 NBA All-Star Game</td><td>1981</td><td>TV Special</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>1979 NBA All-Star Game</td><td>1979</td><td>TV Special</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>1978 NBA All-Star Game</td><td>1978</td><td>TV Special</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>The NBA on CBS</td><td>1976</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Archive Footage <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><h3>Known for movies</h3><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjpqpraGjYrSquMyoqZ5lnprBbsPOq6uhZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./angela-bassett-s-twin-children-are-on-different-pages-when-it-comes-to-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Angela Bassett's Twin Children Are on Different Pages When It Comes to Dating</span></a>
