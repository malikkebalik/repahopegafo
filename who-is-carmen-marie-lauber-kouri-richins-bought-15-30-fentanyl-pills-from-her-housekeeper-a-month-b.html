Reports have said that Carmen Marie Lauber has not yet been charged in the murder of Kouri Richins' husband, Eric Richins. However, her reason to be in court is not yet known.</p><p>It has been alleged that Kouri gave her 39-year-old husband fentanyl after mixing it with his Moscow Mule in March 2022, which resulted in his death. She has now been slapped with aggravated murder and three counts of drug possession with intent to distribute charges. Though there are currently no charges against Lauber, the 51-year-old’s name has been mentioned in numerous court documents in relation to Eric’s death, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">KSL.com</a> reported.</p><h2 class=split>'She stated Kouri paid her approximately $900 each time she supplied the pills'</h2><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Hisham Awartani: GoFundMe set up for Palestinian Ivy League student shot in Vermont and tragically paralyzed from chest down</a></p><p>The two women allegedly exchanged a number of messages from early March 2022 to mid of the month. The court documents stated, “Carmen Lauber was identified as being a housekeeper often used by Kouri for her residential real estate business.” Also, a search warrant affidavit noted, “Lauber admitted to supplying Kouri Richins with 15-30 fentanyl pills on two separate occasions, approximately one month before Eric's death.”</p><p>It added, “She stated Kouri paid her approximately $900 each time she supplied the pills. She provided details of the solicitation of the drugs, the pickup and drop-off locations, and other pertinent details that have been corroborated with digital forensic evidence.”</p><p>Not just that, Lauber’s name has also come up in a civil lawsuit against Kouri, which named the woman only as “C.L.”. It stated, “Upon information and belief, in early February 2022, Kouri asked an acquaintance known as 'C.L.' to procure some fentanyl for her,” before adding, “C.L. delivered those pills to Kouri by hand in the driveway of C.L.'s home.”</p><h2 class=split>Who is Carmen Marie Lauber?</h2><p>According to reports, Lauber has a criminal record. She is a convicted drug dealer, who was found guilty in one case of drug possession with intent to distribute and drug possession, and in a second case of two more counts of drug possession with intent to distribute and drug possession. She was also held behind prison cells for a misdemeanor traffic offense earlier this year.</p><p>The woman even allegedly breached drug court orders and as per an affidavit filed in 4th District Court, “The Summit County Sheriff's Office has been conducting an investigation regarding a death that occurred in March of 2022. During this investigation, information became available that (Carmen) Lauber had a significant illicit drug history and is likely still involved in the possession and distribution of illegal substances.”</p><p><span><b>More from <i>MEAWW</i></b></span></p><p><a href=#>Manuel Rocha: Former US ambassador arrested over accusations of secretly serving as agent for Cuba</a></p><p><a href=#>Arizona student seriously injured in 'promposal'-gone-wrong sues school for $1M</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRor5ikeqq%2FjJyYq6WVo3qurdGinGakkaqvpr6MpKauqpliv6qvx6KlrGWSpMKotNNmaG5lY2V6p7HNrZinsZxivaq4y6xkn6qfonqpsdFmn6ito5q4prHPnqlmmV2ivK%2FAx2aZnp6fp7JusdGimqxllJqutbQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tony-stewart-net-worth-kahawatungu.html><span>←</span><span>Tony Stewart Net Worth - KahawaTungu</span></a>
