For all the wild hearts and adventure lovers, two safety-oriented engineers from Littleton, Colorado, take the Sharks for a ride as they share their product designed to boost visibility while navigating the streets.</p><p>Did you know it weighs 200 grams (7oz)? Sketching out the details of the eye-catching product, the official website reads: “Brake Free is the brightest smart, high visibility helmet accessory with built-in wireless brake detection. It&nbsp;easily mounts to most helmets. It is detachable, so you can mount to multiple helmets and requires&nbsp;no apps, no wiring, and no hassle.”&nbsp;</p><p>What kind of helmet would you need with it? “The Brake Free fits helmet sizes XS to XXL, matte and gloss finish, full face, 3/4 and half helmets. We fit-tested Brake Free on race helmets, street helmets, touring helmets, adventure helmets, modular helmets, and even some skateboard and bike helmets,” the official website claims.</p><h2 class=split>What is Brake Free?&nbsp;</h2><p>Shedding light on the problem for bikers, the <a href=# rel=nofollow>official website</a> explains: “We have a smaller visual footprint, our tail lights are out of eye level of most car drivers, and our brakes don't even show every time we are slowing down. Not to mention our tail light does nothing for us when the cars around us have 10 times the visibility.”</p><p>But they had a solution! “We designed Brake Free to fit on the helmets you already own, so you don't need to buy a new helmet. We built it to be visually stunning, yet functional,” the website explains. “We packed it with 100 ultra-bright LEDs and designed it to have a large visual footprint.” With a newly designed technology, Brake Free is wireless and there is no added fuss in splicing wires, installing apps, or spending a long time installing it on the helmet.&nbsp;</p><p>How to use it? “Simply stick on our universal helmet mount on the back of your helmet, and attach Brake Free, and you're ready to ride. It's simple and removable!” the website explains. It also adds, “Our wireless brake detection technology uses a combination of gyrometer and accelerometers with our powerful and patented brake detection algorithm that can detect any time you’re slowing down: braking, engine braking, or downshifting.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>Who are the founders?</h2><p>Entrepreneurs Henry Li and Alex Arkhangelskiy presented their product to the Sharks. According to the company website, a group of people passionate about motorcycles came together to design it. “We are a team of riders with a passion for motorcycles,”&nbsp;the website reads. “We wanted to share our love for the sport by creating beautiful and highly functional products for our fellow riders.”</p><p>How did the idea for the product come from? “Our company got started on the idea that motorcycle safety does not have to come at the expense of style. We believed safety gear could be functional and stylish,” the official website reads. “We began building our first prototype in April 2014. The idea was simple. Find a way to improve rider visibility with a product the rider would be proud to wear.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/2b117f9f-d789-4a9f-92a9-987333b113aa.jpg><h2 class=split>What is the cost?</h2><p>Wondering what is the cost of wireless Brake Free light? Available at $169.99, the product also includes an option to add protection plans for up to three years. And if you want extra helmet mounts, it is priced at a discounted rate of $12.99 instead of $19.99.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, you also get the Brake Free unit, a Brake Free helmet mount, a Brake Free Micro USB charging cable, a quick start guide, an installation template, and an alcohol wipe with every order.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/4c4a3503-d655-4332-9066-a94c9467c4d0.jpg><h2 class=split>Who will steal the deal?</h2><p>We have a feeling Mark Cuban or Robert Herjavec could grab the deal for Brake Free.
