At the time of the report, Coppola had allegedly lost a slew of talent, designers and the “entire visual effects team.”</p><p>Determined to not squander his money –&nbsp;which he invested in the blockbuster –&nbsp;Coppola denied the allegations <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">to Deadline</a>.</p><p>“I love my cast, I love what I’m getting each day, I am on schedule and on budget, and that’s what is important to me,” he told the outlet.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The 36-year-old actor was seen in all-white garb and adorned in gold jewelry. <span class=credit>OG-MEGA</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Coppola’s “Megalopolis” has found itself in hot water amid accusations that crew members are quitting. <span class=credit>OG-MEGA</span></figure><p>LaBeouf, 36, is no stranger to controversy, of course.</p><p>His latest fiasco was the “Don’t Worry Darling” drama – fueled by none other than girl boss director Olivia Wilde. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The actress claimed she fired</a> former Disney Channel star LaBeouf from the film — which also featured her supposed ex-beau, Harry Styles — but the pair’s stories did not align.</p><p>While Wilde claimed her decision was to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">keep co-star Florence Pugh safe</a>, LaBeouf aired out alleged dirty laundry –&nbsp;or, texts, in this case –&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">even sharing a clip </a>of Wilde reportedly begging him to stay in the cast after he allegedly quit on his own terms.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Following a number of arrests throughout his lifetime, LaBeouf is attempting to turn a new leaf. <span class=credit>OG-MEGA</span></figure><p>LaBeouf’s tumultuous past while growing up in the limelight has earned him a tarnished reputation, one that he’s recently been attempting to polish.</p><p>The born-again Catholic, who supposedly found God while studying for his role in 2022’s “Padre Pio,” recalled the dark place he found himself in at the time, detailing his transgressions in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">an interview last summer</a>.</p><p>“I had been abusive to women and had been shooting dogs and willingly been giving women STDs,” LaBeouf confessed at the time. “It’s disgusting.

The actor, who has faced nearly a dozen arrests, was allegedly smoking cigarettes inside the theater and shouting obscenities, prompting authorities to arrest him during intermission.</p><p>The following year, he was&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">arrested for public intoxication</a>, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">again in 2017</a> along with disorderly conduct and obstruction.
