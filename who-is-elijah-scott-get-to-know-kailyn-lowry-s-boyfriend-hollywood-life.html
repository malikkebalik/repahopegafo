The <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>reality star</a> has taken on the role no fewer than six times now. She welcomed her oldest child <strong>Isaac</strong>, 13, with ex <strong>Jo Rivera</strong>, followed by <strong>Lincoln</strong>, 9, with ex-husband <strong>Javi Marroquin</strong>, and 6-year-old <strong>Lux</strong> and 3-year-old <strong>Creed</strong>&nbsp;with ex <strong>Chris Lopez</strong>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Teen Mom 2</a> alum previously played it coy about whether or not she actually gave birth to her fifth child, Rio, in late 2022. While she seemed to slip up and confirm the birth of a fifth child during a July 2023 episode of her <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Baby Mamas No Drama podcast </a>with <strong>Vee Torres,&nbsp;</strong>she didn’t officially reveal the news herself until October 2023.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>During the October 27 episode of Kailyn’s <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Barely Famous podcast</a>, the reality star revealed she’s now <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>expecting twins with Elijah</a>. Kailyn, who showed off her twin baby bump, admitted she “must have gotten pregnant before” she and Elijah left for a Thailand vacation. “When I got there, I was eating everything. My face was flushed, but I didn’t think anything of it because I was like, there’s no way. There’s no way I am,” Kailyn says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/kailyn-lowry-bf-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>The twins are babies #2 and #3 for Elijah. He’s also Rio’s father. Here’s everything you need to know about Kailyn’s boyfriend and father to three of her kids.</p><h2>Elijah Is a Construction Worker</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>According to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Us Weekly</a>, Kailyn recently shared that her boyfriend “pours concrete” with the best of them. “Get you someone who pours concrete by day and sings R&B by night,” she captioned a June 21, 2023 video on IG stories. He’s also worked in auto repair, running a business called Scott Auto & Motorcycle Repair,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Yahoo</a> reports. It’s unclear if he still works there.</p><h2>He Was in the Army</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Before dabbling in auto repair and construction, Yahoo reports that Elijah served time in the U.S. Army.</p><h2>Elijah Did Not Have Children When He Met Kailyn</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>When the topic once came up of having a fifth child with Elijah during her podcast, Kailyn revealed that her boyfriend didn’t have any kids. “Ah, I don’t know,” she said. “Like the idea of starting over. My youngest [son, Creed] is about to be two. But my boyfriend doesn’t have kids of his own, so it could go either way.”</p><h2>He Was Kailyn’s Neighbor</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>According to the Barely Famous&nbsp;podcast host, the duo met in a rather simple way — they were neighbors in Delaware! “I had already bought my house and moved into my house before I knew that this was your house,” Elijah said during a June 2022 episode of the podcast. Kailyn also revealed she was the one to pursue him.</p><h2>Elijah Takes Care of His Health</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>Elijah and Kailyn hold each other accountable when it comes to staying healthy. “Me and my boyfriend actually send pictures of Open Vitamins that we take every morning,” Kailyn said while promoting the product in April 2022. “He will send me a picture of his and I will send a picture of mine.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2KyrbXJmp9mq5OkwbV5lGpqaWthZXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-does-sa-mean-on-tiktok-exploring-tiktok-slang.html><span>←</span><span>What Does &amp;quot;SA&amp;quot; Mean on TikTok?
