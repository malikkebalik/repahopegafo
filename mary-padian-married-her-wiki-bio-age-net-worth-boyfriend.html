She starred in a spin-off series Storage Wars Texas, before joining the main cast of Storage Wars. In this article, we will take a closer look at the wiki-bio of Mary Padian.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Wiki/Bio Facts</h2><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tr><th>Fact</th><th>Description</th></tr><tbody readability=13.5><tr><td>Full name</td><td>Mary Padian</td></tr><tr><td>Date of birth</td><td>August 24, 1980</td></tr><tr><td>Place of birth</td><td>Dallas, Texas, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Ethnicity</td><td>Irish and Lebanese</td></tr><tr><td>Gender</td><td>Female</td></tr><tr><td>Sexuality</td><td>Straight</td></tr><tr><td>Zodiac sign</td><td>Virgo</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5 feet 1 inch (155 cm)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>48 kg (105 lbs)</td></tr><tr><td>Hair color</td><td>Brown</td></tr><tr><td>Eye color</td><td>Hazel Green</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Education</td><td>Bachelor’s degree in photojournalism from the University of Texas at Austin</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Occupation</td><td>Businesswoman and reality TV star</td></tr><tr><td>Store name</td><td>Mary’s Finds</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Store location</td><td>Fort Worth, Texas, USA (closed)</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Store specialty</td><td>Furniture, antiques, and restoration</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>TV debut</td><td>Storage Wars: Texas (2011)</td></tr><tr><td>TV show</td><td>Storage Wars (2014-2019)</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Nickname</td><td>The Junkster or the Junkyard Queen</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Family</td><td>Father: John Gerard Padian (businessman), Mother: Teresa Ann Padian, Brother: Luke Padian, Uncle: Bady Sassin (attorney)</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Relationship status</td><td>Dating Dylan (last seen in 2016)</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Net worth</td><td>Estimated at $800,000 as of 2023</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Storage-Wars-satar-Mary-Padian-.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Early Life</h2><p>Mary Padian was born on 24th August 1980 in Texas, United States. Born to John and Teresa Padian, Mary shares a mixed descent. Her father, John, comes from an Irish family, while her mother, Teresa, is Lebanese. As a young kid, Mary had a normal life and enjoyed her time in Dallas. Her father operated a junkyard which set the precedence for Mary. After graduating from a local high school, Mary enrolled at the University of Texas at Austin and graduated with a degree in photojournalism in 2003.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Professional Career</h2><p>Mary Padian is an American reality television star and a businesswoman who is best known for her appearance in the popular show Storage Wars. She is also the owner of an online store called Mary’s Finds, where she sells antique and refurbished furniture.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Early Career: From Journalism to Design</h2><p>Straight out of the University, Mary worked as a freelance writer for D Magazine in Dallas Texas. In 2004, she moved to New York City and joined Architectural Digest, a magazine that showcases the work of top architects and designers. She was an assistant editor for the magazine for two years, working under the legendary editor-in-chief Paige Rense. She wrote and edited stories for the magazine and its website, as well as helped with the production of special issues. She also got her own section called ‘Mary Finds’ in 2007 where she posted videos on home refurbishing and decoration. During this time, Mary learned to tap into her artistic side. As she got to rummage through junk appraising and selling vintage items, Mary’s skill as a treasure hunter only continued to grow.</p><p>After 5 years at Architectural Digest, Mary returned to Texas in 2010 and decided to set up a shop. The decision came on the back of her parent’s divorce in 2009. Back in Texas, Mary set up a shop and was mentored by Moe Prigoff.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Storage Wars: Texas: A Breakthrough in Reality TV</h2><p>After setting up shop in 2010, Mary decided to stay in the business for two years and would cash in if she didn’t make money. Mary also closed the shop after failing to realize her goals. However, two days after closing, a woman approached Mary and asked if the stuff was hers. Mary replied that it was and the woman left the shop only to come up the next day. She revealed that she was the producer for Storage Wars: Texas and wanted Mary to film a how-to for the website. Talking about the whole experience, Mary revealed,</p><p>“I just thought that was it, but it turned out that was my interview. I guess it’s because she knew that if she had asked me to be on a reality show, I would have been like, ‘Yeah, right.’ Then I was on the Storage Wars: Texas show. I kept my store open then, and then the Texas show ended, and they asked me to come to California. I said, ‘Why not?’ and so I’m out here now. That’s kind of it in a nutshell.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Mary-Padian.jpg><p>Following their initial conversation, Mary was cast in the reality TV show Storage Wars: Texas. Storage Wars: Texas was a spin-off of the original Storage Wars series, which featured professional buyers bidding on abandoned storage lockers in hopes of finding valuable items. Mary joined the show as a guest star in the first season in 2011.&nbsp;She was paired with her friend Moe Prigoff, a veteran buyer and owner of a furniture store. She quickly became a fan favorite for her quirky personality and enthusiasm.&nbsp;She was nicknamed “The Junkster” for her ability to find treasures in junk.&nbsp;She became a main cast member in the second season and appeared in 58 episodes until the show ended in 2014.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Storage Wars: A New Adventure in California</h3><p>After the cancellation of Storage Wars: Texas, Mary moved to California to join the original Storage Wars series in 2014.&nbsp;She was introduced as a friend of Brandi Passante, one of the main buyers on the show. She continued to showcase her skills and charm as she competed with other buyers for storage lockers across California.&nbsp;She also developed friendships and rivalries with other cast members, such as Darrell Sheets, Jarrod Schulz, Ivy Calvin, and Rene Nezhoda.</p><p>Mary is one of the most popular and successful buyers on the show. She also earned a reputation for being frugal and savvy.&nbsp;She often buys lockers for low prices and sells the items for high profits on her website or at flea markets. Mary appeared in over 59 episodes of Storage Wars until 2019. Since leaving the show, Mary closed the retail shop and took her business online. Mary is also associated with a charity called Ubuntu Life. The charity sells fair-trade products made by Kenyan women to raise money for a clinic targeted toward kids with neurological issues in the country.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Mary’s Finds: A Thriving Online Business</h3><p>Besides being a reality TV star, Mary is also a successful businesswoman. She runs her online store, Mary’s Finds, where she sells antique and refurbished furniture, vintage clothing, jewelry, art, and other unique items. She also offers custom design services for her clients.&nbsp;She sources her products from various places, such as storage auctions, estate sales, thrift stores, and online platforms.</p><p>Mary’s Finds has a loyal customer base and a strong online presence. Her website features a blog where she shares tips and tricks on finding and transforming furniture. &nbsp;Her social media accounts have thousands of followers who admire her style and personality.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Riches and Net Worth</h2><p>Mary Padian has an estimated net worth of $800,000. There is not much information available about Mary Padian’s house, cars, and other possessions.&nbsp;However, she lives in a modest house in Texas where she moved from California after leaving Storage Wars. She also owns a car, but the model and make are unknown. She likes to keep her personal life private and does not flaunt her wealth or assets on social media or in public.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Personal Life: Is Mary Padian married or dating? Kids?</h2><p>Mary Padian has never been married or engaged or given birth to children.&nbsp;She likes to keep her love life private and does not discuss anything about her romantic affairs.&nbsp;However, coming out of her comfort zone, back in 2016 Mary shared Dylan as her boyfriend who also made in an episode of Storage Wars entitled Mary’s Big Score. That was a rare acknowledgment and Dylan even joined her during an auction. Since Mary has not given any updates on her relationship. And going through her&nbsp;Instagram with 360k+ followers she can be seen doing partnerships with different brands and promoting their products however she has not left a clue regarding her current relationship status. As a result, we are not sure if she is still with Dylan as of 2023.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Mary-Padian-holding-her-niece-Lilly-Padian.jpg><p>Delving on to her children, although Mary is yet to give birth to kids of her own she shows affection for little ones.
