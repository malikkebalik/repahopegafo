Parker recently finished recording his 12th studio album, Burning Questions and requested through Capitol Records that MTV air it on their network. Their plan was to produce a video on their own, which MTV would then air.</p><p>However, MTV declined. Their justification, according to a Los Angeles Times article from September 1992, was that their audience—all 63 million households—wouldn’t want to hear Parker’s songs. Parker became incensed by this.</p><p>He said of the procedure,</p><p><strong>“I grew fairly upset at the concept that a record label suddenly had to take the music to the video outlet—not the video.</strong></p><p>The intention of the record labels was to take the audio and ask the artist to create a video for them. He demands creative control over the songs he composed videos.</p><p>He added,</p><p><strong>“I was really insulted.”</strong></p><p>It seemed as if he had been told not to be creative, he stated in a July 2005 interview with Furious.</p><p>In a last-ditch effort, he called a few directors but received the same responses each time. As a result, in his fit of wrath, he had an idea. He wanted his wife to record some films for him.</p><p>I was so furious that I spent $1,400 on a camera and ordered my wife to be the cameraperson, Parker recalled. Learn how to make use of this, he said.</p><p>Jolie didn’t feel it was a big ask, though. Since the 1980s, she had been taking pictures of her husband’s record covers, mostly because he detested going to professional photo shoots.</p><p>So they ventured outside to capture a video in their New York garden for the album’s opening track, “Release Me.” For between $4,000 and $5,000, including editing, they completed the movie.</p><p>According to Parker, “It was a lot of fun.” He returned the video to Capitol. He made a remark, but the hand-over produced no results. For having the guts to accomplish something like that, he also rose to fame among many in the music industry and beyond.</p><h2><span id=Family_Life_of_Graham_Parker_with_Wife_and_Children>Family Life of Graham Parker with Wife and Children</span></h2><p>Before being made to serve as his impromptu videographer in 1991, Parker and his wife had been married for a very long time. They started dating before 1980, and he even made a song from his 1980 album The Up Escalator called “Jolie Jolie” about her.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: M.
