It was Oct. 8, 2003, and actor Alan Thicke was at Melnyk’s side, helping him kick off a free Eagles concert for season ticket holders, suite owners and sponsors of the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Senators</a>.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>The 44-year-old billionaire introduced a new era for the franchise with a bang, an event that cost more than $2 million. And he knew the right notes to hit with the team’s most fervent fans. Earlier, during the summer, he assured locals who had long worried about the team relocating, “I’m guaranteeing you the team is going to be staying in Ottawa now.”</p><p>Melnyk had purchased the Senators and the arena in Kanata for $92 million, after the franchise had fallen into bankruptcy protection, with creditors owed more than $200 million. The financial instability that marred the franchise was a thing of the past now, he assured the locals. “There is stability that you can count on,” he said at the time. “The fans can count on, the players, the vendors can count on.”</p><p>The Eagles’ set lasted an hour-and-a-half, with two encores. Melnyk took in the show with his wife, Laura; the couple celebrated their ninth wedding anniversary that night.</p><p>The next evening, the Senators hosted the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Montreal Canadiens</a> in the season opener — a 5-2 win — the first victory of the Melnyk era.</p><p>It was a blissful and upbeat time for Senators fans and those in the organization, as beginnings often are. Middles and endings can be messier, and for Melnyk that was certainly the case.</p><p>Melnyk’s death on March 28, 2022, and the <a href=#>uncertainty around</a> who will lead the team in the future, brings about a moment to assess his almost 19 seasons as the franchise’s leader. When Melnyk purchased the team, the Senators were stacked with talent. They had advanced to the conference final the previous season before losing to the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>New Jersey Devils</a>, the eventual Stanley Cup winners. But since then, their success has been sporadic. Progress, like a run to the 2007 Stanley Cup Final, was marred by messy divorces with some of the organization’s most beloved players, squandered talent and organizational resources, and a wholesale erosion of trust between the team, its loyal fan base, and the greater Ottawa community.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>The team’s performance over the years has been as erratic as the owner himself. Melnyk could be charming and charismatic; he could be benevolent. He was also, at times, a tyrant, and by the end there weren’t many people in the organization or in the community who considered him an asset.</p><p>Plenty of owners fail to win big; that is not the reason fans and Senators employees grew disillusioned with Melnyk. His personality, his way of doing business, the beliefs he tried to impose upon others, his disregard for those operating and playing for his team, pervaded the franchise for almost two decades, and it wore people down. His death brings up complicated feelings — a somber sense of finality on a chaotic chapter for the team and, ultimately, a sliver of hope that the franchise can start fresh.</p><p>On stage in 2003 to introduce the Eagles, Melnyk surely foresaw a different legacy. And to those in the audience, he appeared to be the white knight the team needed.</p><p>He absolutely loved hockey. In his youth, Melnyk became an ardent fan of the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Toronto Maple Leafs</a>. He couldn’t afford to watch his favorite team play at Maple Leaf Gardens. But he forged a deep passion for the game, playing ball hockey on neighborhood streets and in a local youth rec league.</p><p>In 1982, Melnyk, then 23, founded a publishing company, Trimel Corp., and within five years it was one of the biggest medical publishing firms in Canada. Just shy of 30 years old, Melnyk sold Trimel’s magazines to publishing giant Thomson Corp. in 1989 for more than $8 million. He then invested in a burgeoning Swiss medical company called Biovail. Within a decade, Melnyk was chairman of the board at Biovail. By 2000, his net worth was estimated to be $1.5 billion.</p><p>He was a self-made man whose brash, bombastic personality never seemed to fit with a staid, hard-working government city with a large base of civil servants dedicated to decorum and order. Yet, his governing principles as an iconoclast — eager to show up the big kids on the playground, the white-shoe pharmaceutical firms and the league’s elite — reflected some of the long-simmering sentiments amongst the fan base. The city of Ottawa is Canada’s capital, yet it’s a region where people often feel overshadowed and underappreciated. In professional sports, that can be a winning formula — an owner with gobs of money desperate to prove he belongs, supported by fans as fervent to see their team prosper, hoping that his stewardship provides its deliverance.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>On that October evening in 2003 at the Corel Centre, everything seemed aligned. As the Eagles sang, it portended an era of “peaceful easy feeling.”</p><p>It was the opposite.</p><p>From the moment Melnyk took ownership of the team, a transaction that required approval by a court monitor <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">representing the team’s creditors</a>, it was clear that he’d bring a new flavor of leadership to a franchise that had been run by a tightly knit group of staffers, many of whom had been there since the club’s founding in 1992.</p><p>Melnyk spent most of his time in Barbados, at a mansion on a three-acre property that looked out from a cliff over a white-sand beach to the sea. The property had two guest homes and a detached gymnasium and a 3,000-bottle wine cellar. A sunken room held Melnyk’s piano; he played keyboards in a band called the Studebakers after high school and once hired Meatloaf to play a private concert for his friends in Barbados.</p><p>Melnyk would summon team executives down to the island to present budgets and plans. He often wore flip-flops, shorts and a T-shirt around the island. He was a regular at Bert’s, a local bar, where he was an avid participant in its annual <a class=ath_autolink href=#>NFL</a> pool. (He’d later purchase Bert’s and create a replica at the Senators’ home rink.) But the casual attire belied the intensity with which he exerted control over most decisions. In these meetings, Melnyk was strong-minded and hands-on, even in areas where he lacked expertise, like hockey personnel.</p><p>When he came to Ottawa, he’d arrive on his Gulfstream jet and check into the Brookstreet Hotel. Around the office, Melnyk could strike an abrasive, intimidating tone, sometimes cursing and angrily announcing that he would fix perceived problems on his own. He also would get noticeably inebriated at games, which made some team employees uncomfortable.</p><p>By at least 2007, a glimpse of him acting erratically or smelling like hard liquor would prompt a collective effort by those around him to keep him away from television cameras or the Senators locker room, as his visits irritated some staffers and players.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>After the Senators’ run to the Stanley Cup Final in 2007 ended with a 6-2 loss to the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Anaheim Ducks</a> in Game 5, Melnyk stood in the middle of the visitors dressing room and delivered a speech to the dejected players that went on several wild tangents. At one point, he declared that he was once a goalie and pretended to make stick saves in front of the players. Melnyk, who to many in the room appeared intoxicated, also had a hard time identifying Ottawa players outside of stars like Daniel Alfredsson, Jason Spezza and Dany Heatley.</p><p>“It was beyond embarrassing,” says one person who was in the room.</p><p>As he addressed the team, Melnyk became extremely agitated that the Ducks noisy celebration outside was interfering with his speech.</p><p>“Tell them to shut the fuck up and turn that music down,” he yelled.</p><p>Melnyk then made a memorable vow to the players, promising if they ever won the Stanley Cup, their rings would be the size of animals. “He started by saying they would be the size of beavers. Then he said they would be the size of deer,” says a former player. “And then it was (that) the rings would be the size of a moose. It just got progressively bigger.”</p><p>There were other wild, meandering speeches and unpredictable outbursts.</p><p>Three years earlier, upon losing Game 7 to Toronto in the first round of the playoffs — after the Senators owner <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">proclaimed</a> his team was going to “kill” the Maple Leafs — an enraged Melnyk went on an expletive-laced tirade that culminated with him throwing chairs down the hallway next to the visitors dressing room.</p><p>One player called Melnyk’s general behavior around the team “Mickey Mouse.”</p><p>But winning can conceal deeper issues, at least temporarily. Even though the Senators fell short of the ultimate goal in 2007, Melnyk was still spending close to the salary cap. The team was devoting resources to scouting and player acquisitions. The staff was robust, budgets were reasonable and there was creative freedom to expand the team’s footprint in the community.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>The 2007 Christmas party was a lavish affair, with the club renting out a casino in Hull, QC. Morale was high. “People were happy, people were proud to work there,” one said. “It was a badge of honor.”</p><p>Over the next several years, the feelings inside the organization changed. The purse strings tightened. Budgets were cut and expenditures were slashed. A series of high-profile terminations and departures rattled the rank and file. People feared for their jobs and wondered whether Melnyk truly had deep pockets.</p><p>Around this time, Melnyk was grappling with professional and personal setbacks.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2022/04/13134445/Melny-and-biovail-e1649871916642.jpg alt width=1633 height=1088 sizes="(max-width: 1633px) 100vw, 1633px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=table-cell-span></span> <span class=credits-text>Eugene Melnyk, pictured here in 2004 at a Biovail Corp. annual meeting in Toronto. (Norm Betts / Bloomberg via Getty Images)</span><p>In May 2008, Biovail (from <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">which he had previously stepped down</a> as CEO shortly after the Securities and Exchange Commission alleged “<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">breaches of securities laws</a>”), was forced to pay a $24.6 million fine as part of a plea bargain to avoid further litigation over kickback and conspiracy charges. This after already paying $10 million to settle an SEC complaint just a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">few months earlier</a> and $138 million to settle a class-action suit filed against the company by a Canadian Union pension fund <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">in 2007</a>. Melnyk was also hit with a five-year ban in 2011 from holding any senior roles at public companies by the Ontario Securities Commission, formally reprimanded, and forced to pay $565,000 toward the regulatory probe into his conduct, which found that he acted <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">“contrary to the public interest.”</a></p><p>Additionally, Melnyk and his wife split in 2010 (the terms of which would be litigated for the next decade). People in the organization say his anger and unpredictability gradually increased in the years that followed the dissolution of his marriage.</p><p>Within the first few months of 2011, veteran players Mike Fisher, Chris Kelly, Alexei Kovalev and Jarkko Ruutu were shipped out of town in return for draft picks. From that point on, spending decreased, with the team’s payroll shrinking significantly below the salary cap. After gutting a portion of the roster, the Senators made two surprising runs to the playoffs in 2012 and 2013. They did so while being endearingly referred to as the “Pesky Sens” — a moniker that highlighted an ability to overcome adversity and punch above their weight.</p><p>But the goodwill and momentum around the club — which was buoyed by an emotional playoff series win over Montreal in May 2013 — quickly vanished that summer.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>When Daniel Alfredsson, the team captain and franchise icon, signed a free agent contract with <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Detroit</a> in July, he accused the Senators of failing to follow through on a promise to sign him to a contract extension on two occasions. Melnyk was outraged by Alfredsson’s departure, referring to him as a “prick” and “an asshole” to members of the Senators executive staff as they mulled over ideas for how to handle the public messaging of his departure. The owner lumped Alfredsson in with Dany Heatley, another star player, who demanded a trade out of Ottawa four years earlier. Melnyk did not want the club to promote Alfredsson’s much-anticipated return to Ottawa as a member of the Red Wings in December 2013; he suggested the marketing department triple the price for tickets to that game.</p><p>Short periods of on-ice success helped to assuage some of the plummeting morale, but gradually the notion that Melnyk was a deep-pocketed savior dissipated, and his behavior became more difficult to ignore.</p><p>Team president Anthony LeBlanc, in responding to a request for comment, said via email that the “timing and sudden urgency of The Athletic’s article on Eugene Melnyk so soon after his death is remarkably insensitive.” He said that “the rush to publish a story with very little new or time sensitive information” was “both questionable and opportunistic.”</p><p>In the mid-1990s, Melnyk became heavily involved in a charity called Help Us Help The Children, which supported orphans in Ukraine. Melnyk, the son of Ukrainian immigrants, traveled to his ancestral homeland many times — on top of donating close to $10 million in direct funding and goods, including bags of Ottawa Senators paraphernalia like sweaters, scarves and pucks.</p><p>“Whatever he could fit in the plane he would bring for the kids to have,” said Ruslana Wrzesnewskyj, one of the charity’s founders.</p><p>On one trip, in the early 2010s, Melnyk met Serhiy Perepiatenko, who had grown up in the country’s foster care system and remained close to the charity after it had supported him in his youth. Perepiatenko, who was in his mid-20s, was an IT expert and helped Melnyk fix his broken laptop.</p><p>Impressed by the young man’s talent with computers, Melnyk offered Perepiatenko an opportunity to move from Ukraine to Barbados, working directly for him.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Perepiatenko arrived in Barbados in 2014. Melnyk gave him an apartment near his estate — and a car to drive around town. Perepiatenko paid for everything else out of the modest salary Melnyk gave him. Perepiatenko oversaw digital security for his properties, business interests and the private school Melnyk owned in Barbados. He managed Melnyk’s properties on the island and sometimes drove Melnyk and his daughters, Anna and Olivia, who grew up in Barbados and attended the school Melnyk founded before moving on to attend boarding school in Canada. He was also tasked with overviewing the IT systems and security used by the Senators front office, making equipment and software suggestions.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2022/04/13121300/Melnyk-and-Perepiatenko-e1649866422339.jpg alt width=1036 height=691 sizes="(max-width: 1036px) 100vw, 1036px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=table-cell-span></span> <span class=credits-text>Eugene Melnyk and Serhiy Perepiatenko, circa 2014. (Courtesy of Serhiy Perepiatenko)</span><p>Perepiatenko became very close with Melnyk, he says, almost like family. Melnyk gave Perepiatenko a dog, a Rhodesian Ridgeback. They watched Senators games together at Bert’s Bar. They would sit together in the living room of the mansion&nbsp;—&nbsp;Melnyk’s favorite part of the house —&nbsp;with its enormous television, an aquarium, and floor-to-ceiling windows that overlooked the ocean and a swimming pool. They would eat Ukrainian food that Perepiatenko and his wife cooked.</p><p>Under Melnyk’s guidance, Perepiatenko says he learned to carry himself and speak with confidence. He became organized and motivated. He watched how Melnyk would speak to people, trying to provoke reactions and read how they responded. He watched how Melnyk always seemed confident in his opinions.</p><p>Perepiatenko never had a strong, consistent role model in his life before. “He was like a father to me,” he says.</p><p>But for his many acts of kindness, Melnyk could also be accusatory and defensive. Melnyk would often deny saying things that he’d said not long before. Perepiatenko took care to write emails to Melnyk outlining what they had discussed regarding work-related matters because Melnyk would often deny approving things he previously had. Melnyk also distrusted people around his estate in Barbados.</p><p>“The one thing he was always telling me was that ‘everyone is stealing money from me,’” Perepiatenko says.</p><p>Once, when Perepiatenko visited, Melnyk accused him of stealing ice cream. He also told Perepiatenko that someone was stealing coffee pods from the house.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>In May 2015, while in poor health for months following a stroke, Melnyk — then soon to turn 56 years old — made a public appeal to find a donor for a liver transplant. More than 500 people, including Perepiatenko, offered to donate part of their liver to Melnyk.</p><p>Melnyk underwent an eight-hour procedure in Toronto in mid-May, receiving part of a liver from an anonymous donor whose only request, passed on by the hospital, was that Melnyk return to good health to enjoy his family and friends — and that the Senators win the Stanley Cup.</p><p>Some close to Melnyk hoped he’d emerge from the health scare with a new perspective. But while at times he could show more compassion and patience, the medication he was on left him prone to mood swings. In court documents filed in Barbados related to his divorce, Melnyk said in an email to his wife: “Ignore me if I say something stupid; they pump me full of steroids.”</p><p>In early December 2018, Perepiatenko flew into Toronto from Barbados to attend a job interview for a new IT position with a company in Ottawa. After nearly five years living on the island, Perepiatenko hoped to land a job in Canada. Melnyk had initially been supportive of Perepiatenko’s goal to join an Ottawa company, Perepiatenko said, but then became perturbed by his decision to leave.</p><p>When he arrived at customs at Toronto’s Pearson International Airport, Perepiatenko was stopped, questioned in a private room and had his luggage searched.</p><p>A couple of days later, he was Melnyk’s guest at the Senators game in Ottawa. After the game — a 2-1 Senators win over the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Penguins</a> —&nbsp; Perepiatenko followed Melnyk to a room on the ground floor of the Canadian Tire Centre (previously known as the Corel Centre), with a round table in it. Inside, Melnyk introduced Perepiatenko to a man that he was told was a police officer from Toronto. Perepiatenko said that Melnyk told him that Perepiatenko had been discovered with a large quantity of cash after being searched at the border, which Perepiatenko denied.</p><p>About a month earlier, Melnyk had claimed to Perepiatenko that more than $12,000 in cash had been stolen from his estate in Barbados.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Melnyk then claimed that he’d also visited the house where Perepiatenko was staying in Toronto and had gone through his bags. He said he found tech equipment that Melnyk believed belonged to him. Melnyk told him that the man standing beside him was now in possession of all of those items. He told Perepiatenko that he would go to jail unless he confessed to stealing the money.</p><p>“Eugene, I’m not going to jail because I didn’t do anything,” Perepiatenko said.</p><p>Melnyk became angry and yelled at him, Perepiatenko recalls. Melnyk told the security officer standing at the door behind him to throw him out of the arena.</p><p>“You cannot just throw me away like garbage,” Perepiatenko said.</p><p>The security guards, who knew Perepiatenko from his many visits to the arena, stepped aside as Perepiatenko stormed out of the room and left the arena.</p><p>“I just threw away five, six years,” he says. “I had to start my life all over.”</p><p>“Are you the one responsible for this fucking gay campaign? Have you lost your fucking mind? You need to take that shit down immediately.”</p><p>It was a Friday evening, Feb. 8, 2019, when a team executive received the phone call, Melnyk’s nasal screaming reverberating on the other line.</p><p>Melnyk was incensed at a marketing campaign with the slogan “Love is Love” that included still images of same-sex couples embracing and kissing that had been used to promote an upcoming Senators game for the NHL’s “Hockey is for Everyone” night. The campaign was designed to celebrate diversity and inclusion and to connect with members of the Ottawa community previously left out of the organization’s outreach efforts.</p><p>Melnyk sneered at the images and derided the campaign: “We are the laughing stock of the NHL right now!”</p><p>Melnyk’s rant continued, lumping in previous marketing efforts involving pet rescue missions: “They think we are so desperate that we have to advertise to gays now. Dogs and gays.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Celebrate love with the Ottawa Senators at Love is Love; Hockey is for Everyone night, Tuesday, Feb. 12, at 7:30 p.m.</p><p>Join in the celebration and share a photo of you and your love for a chance to be featured in-game using <a href=#>#sensloveislove</a> !</p><p>TICKETS: <a href=#>https://t.co/xtGP0ip4lx</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/nuI009mGic</a></p><p>— Ottawa Senators (@Senators) <a href=#>February 8, 2019</a></p><p>The Athletic reviewed contemporaneous notes taken by the executive to memorialize the exchange. Another employee involved with the campaign, who spoke to the executive soon after the call from Melnyk, corroborated the executive’s retelling.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Melnyk, in an email exchange that has been reviewed by The Athletic, protested that he had not sanctioned the campaign and threatened “serious consequences,” asking why it was necessary to use “sexually implicit pictures” to promote inclusiveness.</p><p>Despite Melnyk’s tirade, the campaign was not pulled. However, multiple employees said they witnessed Melnyk rail on the executive in the months that followed — expressing regret for not firing the person at the time and reiterating his disgust at the content.</p><p>“I paid the price for that campaign,” the executive said.</p><p>Later in February 2019, a group from the marketing department went to the Winterlude Pride celebration. When they returned to the office, they were informed by a marketing director that Melnyk was not happy about the group’s attendance.</p><p>Also that year, Melnyk sent a threatening email to a female employee who had not responded immediately to an email Melnyk sent her. When she finally wrote back, reminding Melnyk she was on a scheduled vacation, he responded in all caps: “YOU FUCKING C – – T – WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? WHEN I SAY CALL YOU DO IT. WHEN I TELL YOU TO DO SOMETHING YOU DO IT. YOU ARE DONE!”</p><p>That same female employee had received a threatening email from Melnyk about a year earlier that includes the lines: “You really are a dumb bitch who doesn’t get it. How dare you write and question me” and “You are a no one.”</p><p>He ended that email, as he often did, with “Carpe Diem.”</p><p>The executive who was berated by Melnyk for the “Love is Love” campaign spoke with two officials from the league office about Melnyk’s actions. (The Athletic reviewed emails arranging that meeting.) The executive is unaware if the league took any action based on that disclosure. The NHL did not respond to a request for comment. The woman who was sent the threatening emails in 2018 and 2019 said she never shared the content of those emails with anyone from the league office. She was afraid that Melnyk would seek retribution if she did.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>During “Blackout Tuesday” not long after the murder of George Floyd in Minnesota in May 2020, Melnyk sent an email to some senior staffers instructing them not to post a blank black page that many teams had posted in support of Black Lives Matter: “No social media today. People are posting completely black pages and it is some type of social distress that is causing this,” he wrote. “Let’s just not post anything today, but I would not bother posting a black screen. Check to see whether any other NHL team is doing it.”</p><p>The team’s failure to acknowledge the Black Lives Matter protest was particularly disappointing to some employees because it signaled a lack of support for <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Anthony Duclair</a>, then a Senators forward, who is Black.</p><p>“It was embarrassing,” the employee said. “We couldn’t do the bare minimum for him.”</p><p>On June 5, nearly two weeks after Floyd’s death, the team issued a statement on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">social media</a> saying: “The Ottawa Senators hockey club strongly believes that racism and violence have no place in a civilized society.” However, the statement was widely panned on social media for not including the phrase “Black Lives Matter” or George Floyd’s name. Duclair was deeply disappointed by the bland statement.</p><p>Melnyk could be paranoid about how employees spent their time and their productivity – he’d email at all hours of the night and expect prompt replies, grumble about employees working from home and even restricted access to streaming services like YouTube and Spotify. He had arbitrary rules (employees, at one point, were prohibited from sending out emails to more than 10 recipients at a time) and his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">extreme</a> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">litigiousness</a> added to a sense of fear around the office. Some around Melnyk felt his volatility was at least partly attributable to medications he was taking. Others believed this was just who he was, unpredictable, erratic and eager to exert control over the workplace.</p><p>Melnyk preferred to work to the sound of music. He had staff members set up a laptop with speakers to play music — Coldplay was often his artist of choice. When staffers heard music in the hallways, it was an ominous signal — Melnyk was in town — and people braced for him to harangue their job performance. Employees used aliases such as “Eagle” to signal his arrival (as in, “the Eagle has landed”).</p><p>“People were scared to even speak his name,” said one former employee.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>In a 2019 review of the organization done by an outside consultant — the findings were shared with The Athletic — employees said they “lived in a constant state of fear that paralyzes the organization.” Employees told the consultants they believed their emails were being monitored. They shared rumors “that the ceilings are bugged.”</p><p>The review, which was completed by Level5 Strategy, a firm used by other NHL organizations, included quotes from some employees. Among them:</p><p>“When you walk into this building, it’s so toxic.”</p><p>“We’re a little more beaten down each day that goes by. It’s a battle to the end to see who can last. It’s the war of attrition here.”</p><p>To solicit internal feedback for this review, employees spanning all different departments and seniority levels were gathered in small groups for breakout sessions. These “focus groups” quickly became forums for uninhibited venting and vitriol. One person who was new to the Senators organization was taken aback by how “ruthless” employees’ remarks were. Another person who participated in these breakout sessions said the representatives from the consultancy seemed shaken by the scale of the discontent.</p><p>It was the second workplace culture review commissioned by the Senators in as many years. One conducted in fall 2017 by McLean & Company found that only 6.1 percent of respondents said they’d recommend the company as a place to work to family and friends; only 11 percent felt their pay was competitive with other companies. The 2019 review was more exhaustive, as Level5 also interviewed executive leadership, season-ticket holders and fans.</p><p>It was also far more damming.</p><p>In a summary of findings written in August 2019 and labeled “The Bitter Truth,” Level5 concluded:</p><ul><li aria-level=1>The Senators as a brand, a business, and a hockey team are facing an existential crisis that threatens the club</li><li aria-level=1>The business will not improve if it continues to operate in a way it is operating today; substantial change is required in order to accomplish a substantial turnaround</li><li aria-level=1>Currently, the Senators have no brand; the Eugene Melnyk brand is overwhelming the Senators brand and it is negatively impacting the organization</li></ul><p>The Senators, when asked if any changes had been enacted once the culture review was completed, said they would “not comment publicly on a three-year-old internal survey.”</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>In March 2020, Senators CEO Jim Little was fired after less than a year on the job. His exit followed a heated phone call with Melnyk that was overheard by several people within the office. Little described Melnyk as a “fucking joke,” and said the way he ran the team was an embarrassment, according to two people who overheard Little’s end of the conversation. The following week, Little was escorted out of the building by security. Little declined to comment about the incident.</p><p>His brief tenure was not an anomaly; many high-ranking employees have left the team in the last few years. Since January 2015, the list includes at least four chief financial officers (one has since returned), three presidents/chief executive officers, two chief marketing officers, three directors of human resources; a vice president of broadcasting, vice president of strategic development, vice president of corporate strategy and sales, chief operating officer, and the team’s general counsel.</p><p>Melnyk also “fired” senior staff members on a regular basis, although he rarely followed through on those terminations. It was not uncommon for executives to be told to clean out their desks but return to the office the next day as if nothing had happened.</p><p>That high turnover in senior staff allowed Melnyk to centralize power and provide oversight on items traditionally delegated to senior executives, such as employee compensation plans. Melnyk would sometimes hand out bonuses at his sole discretion and create arbitrary reasons to justify withholding them. (In 2017, Peter O’Leary sued the Senators for breach of contract for his dismissal, claiming he was not paid a $20,000 bonus and that Melnyk “sent abusive emails to the executive team and frequently threatened to dismiss them.” The suit <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">has since been resolved</a>.)</p><p>Says one long-time salesperson, “We definitely got paid less than what we agreed to. And I’ll just say compensation became a very gray area. It was a crapshoot every year.”</p><p>Employees often had the unenviable task of trying to mend fraught relationships with business partners who were routinely stiffed. One long-time supplier said: “I don’t think there is any business in this city that has been paid on time by them.”</p><p>Word of these cost-cutting measures made its way to the locker room.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>“You can do those sorts of things to players. Trade us. Put us on waivers. Send us to the minors. Buy us out. Whatever. But at the end of the day, we always get paid,” says a former Ottawa player. “It’s how you treat everyone else in the organization that matters. How you treat the behind-the-scenes people — that says more about you.”</p><p>But things have apparently improved on this front in recent weeks. One supplier — who was chasing payment on an invoice from the 2019-20 season — was recently paid in full. He told The Athletic he was “shocked” to be repaid after so long, but said he believes the club is making a concerted effort to repair damaged relationships with the local business community.</p><p>LeBlanc said the team’s dealings with business partners are “up to date” and that the team does not normally “comment publicly about compensation and employment matters. That being said we can tell you that we honour all of our commitments to our employees.”</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2018/05/28162211/GettyImages-98485596.jpg alt width=3000 height=2000 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=table-cell-span></span> <span class=credits-text>Eugene Melnyk, with Daniel Alfredsson, during a pregame ceremony in 2010 honoring Alfredsson for his 1,000th game played. (Phillip MacCallum / Getty Images)</span><p>The only two modern-day Senators players to have their jerseys retired by the club are living in Ottawa but have no official connection with the team.</p><p>Alfredsson, who only returned to the team the second time on the condition that his contact with Melnyk was limited, walked away from the club again in the summer of 2017, disenchanted with the direction of the franchise. He has no relationship with the team.</p><p>Chris Phillips, the organization’s defensive stalwart and longest-tenured player, also has no affiliation with the franchise. He worked with the charitable arm of the organization, but after less than a year — in June 2021 — Phillips submitted his resignation without offering a public explanation.</p><p>Over the course of three years, from 2017-20, the Senators jettisoned virtually every popular veteran player from their roster, including Kyle Turris, <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Derick Brassard</a>, Dion Phaneuf, <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Mike Hoffman</a>, Zack Smith, <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Erik Karlsson</a>, <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Dylan DeMelo</a>, <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Matt Duchene</a>, Ryan Dzingel, <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Mark Stone</a>, <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Mark Borowiecki</a> and <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Jean-Gabriel Pageau</a>. Though the bulk of these departures and moves represented the club’s efforts to rebuild, that roster retooling has yet to yield results; this will be the<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"> fifth straight year</a> the team has failed to make the playoffs.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>At a media session at Parliament Hill in December 2017 — on the eve of the club hosting the Montreal Canadiens in an outdoor game — Melnyk crossed a line of demarcation, openly musing about moving the team. “If it doesn’t look good here, it could look very, very nice somewhere else, but I’m not suggesting that right now,” Melnyk said. “All I’m saying is that I would never sell the team.”</p><p>For all his antics and flaws, for all his mistreatment of others, for how the club became mired in mediocrity, the one silver lining from his tenure was that Melnyk had always vowed he wouldn’t move the team. That sliver of good was now erased. One fan raised $10,000 in a GoFundMe campaign to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">erect four billboards</a> in the city that included the hashtag #MelnykOut.</p><p>The effects were felt at the box office, as empty seats inside the Canadian Tire Centre became such an eyesore that the club concealed them by <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">placing a black tarp over several rows</a> at the top of the seating bowl during the 2017-18 season. By 2021-22, the club had a season ticket base of approximately 4,000 — a drastic tumble from the all-time high of around 13,000 it achieved shortly after reaching the Stanley Cup Final in 2007.</p><p>The players who weren’t sent away and those working for the organization continued to endure Melnyk’s behavior.</p><p>In March 2017, Melnyk called <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Sidney Crosby</a> a “whiner beyond belief,” a comment that rankled Crosby and teammates. Later that season, after the Senators beat the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Bruins</a> in a playoff series, Melnyk taunted Bruins players, mimicking a golf swing when they passed him in the hallway at Boston’s TD Garden to let them know their season had ended.</p><p>“He chirped <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Patrice Bergeron</a>,” one Senators player said. “Imagine disrespecting one of the classiest players in the game? But it didn’t shock me at all. I was just like, ‘Well, that’s our owner.’”</p><p>Commentary about Melnyk’s legacy, savage and unflinching behind the scenes in recent years, has been decidedly more anodyne since his death. Even his staunchest critics have softened their rhetoric, or at least remained mum. Players Chris Neil and Karlsson shared acts of kindness. Neil <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">said Melnyk sent a private plane</a> for him and other members of the organization to bring the group to Neil’s mother’s funeral; Karlsson acknowledged he had little contact with Melnyk since the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">trade</a> in 2018, but he called Melnyk “<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">a passionate owner</a>” and said he had sent flowers to his family upon the birth of both of his children.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Nic Ruszkowski, a former Senators executive who had several significant rows with Melnyk, opined on Melnyk’s “complexities” in a Facebook post, detailing the “infinite affection” Melnyk had for his daughters, his philanthropic efforts, and his innate toughness. He added: “When local anger about his ownership was at its peak, I remember asking him if he had an exit strategy and if he’d ever consider using it. (He said:) ‘Exit strategy? My exit strategy is my coffin.’”</p><p>Perepiatenko, the Ukrainian who Melnyk helped before casting him away, moved back to Ukraine in 2019. He and Melnyk talked sporadically; Melnyk remained insistent that Perepiatenko had taken his money, refusing to see him again unless he admitted it, despite the fact that Perepiatenko sent him records from the Canadian Border Services Agency confirming that no money was found when he was searched.</p><p>In December 2021, he reached out to Melnyk to tell him that he’d re-married and recently welcomed his first child. He sent Melnyk photos of his baby girl, Eva.</p><p>“She’s very beautiful,” Melnyk told him.</p><p>As tensions grew with Russian aggression in Ukraine in early February, Melnyk called Perepiatenko and asked for his bank account information. The next day, Perepiatenko says, his account had been wired money to pay for his family to leave Kyiv. Unable to secure a flight to Barbados, Perepiatenko drove his family to Holland instead.</p><p>They arrived on Feb. 24, just as the Russian invasion of Ukraine began.</p><p>For a couple of weeks, Perepiatenko tried to reach Melnyk to thank him for his gift, offering to pay him back, but didn’t receive a reply. In mid-March, Perepiatenko and Melnyk spoke by phone. Melnyk, by then very ill, insisted Perepiatenko and his family return to Barbados, though he chided him while making the gesture: “You didn’t call me, so you blew your chance.”</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>“That’s the way our communication was,” Perepiatenko says, laughing.</p><p>After the call, Perepiatenko was worried he might never again see the man who became like a father to him. Future messages went unanswered. A little more than a week later, he woke to a text message from a friend in Canada sharing the news of Melnyk’s death.</p><p>“I feel crushed now,” says Perepiatenko. “I loved this man.”</p><p>(Illustration: John Bradford / The Athletic.
